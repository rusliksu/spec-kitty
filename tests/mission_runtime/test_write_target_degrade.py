"""Tests for the shared write-target degrade helper (FR-005, WP04).

This module tests the public entry points (decision_log and bookkeeping_commit)
to verify observable behavior through their call sites, confirming that each
preserves its distinct degrade policy (fail-open vs. fail-closed).

Red-first assertion: in the no-``meta.json`` bootstrap window:
- decision_log's resolve returns ``CommitTarget(ref=destination_ref)`` (fail-open)
- bookkeeping_commit's resolve **raises** when its branch is None (fail-closed)

See spec: FR-005, C-004; plan IC-06a.
