"""RED-FIRST P0 reproduction of #2782 per ADR 2026-07-17-1
(docs/adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1-red-main-is-honest-ci-is-release-authority.md).
Intentionally FAILS until the product bug is fixed — a red mainline is the
honest signal of this release-blocking P0. Do NOT xfail/skip/quarantine to
green; fix the product. Tracking issue: #2782.

Extracted (landing fold: make ``@pytest.mark.regression`` mean exactly one
thing) from ``tests/sync/test_strict_json_stdout.py``, which carries only
this one regression-marked test alongside several unrelated, passing
strict-JSON-contract tests. This module imports the shared subprocess/home
isolation harness from that file read-only (``_worktree_src``,
``_build_isolated_home``, ``_resolve_in_tree_specify_cli``,
``_run_cli_isolated``, ``_stop_isolated_sync_daemon``,
``_scaffold_minimal_kittify_repo``) rather than duplicating it — the same
established pattern already used elsewhere in this suite for cross-file
harness reuse (see e.g. ``tests/merge/test_executor_coord_reconcile.py``
importing from ``tests/merge/test_issue_2367_bake_strand.py``).

Symptom: ``spec-kitty agent mission create --json`` must stay strict JSON on
stdout even when the sync layer skips direct ingress and reports the skip
diagnostic on stderr (AC-006 / FR-009 / FR-010 / NFR-003). On main today the
sync layer instead hits an auth-failure/connection-refused path before the
private-team-missing skip fires. Expected red until #2782 closes.

    """AC-006 (literal): ``agent mission create --json`` stdout stays strict JSON when sync skips ingress.

    Cycle-3 review noted the prior subprocess smoke covered
    ``agent tasks status --json``, but AC-006 names ``spec-kitty agent
    mission create --json`` *specifically* -- the command that mints a
    new mission and has the strongest motivation to emit
    success-payload JSON to stdout while sync side-effects fire on
    stderr. This test exercises that exact contract.

    Setup mirrors the cycle-2 ``agent tasks status`` test:

    * fresh isolated ``HOME`` with a seeded shared-only encrypted
      ``StoredSession`` so the ingress resolver actually runs and can
      land on the ``direct ingress skipped`` path;
    * isolated ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` so the runtime cache is fresh;
    * ``SPEC_KITTY_ENABLE_SAAS_SYNC=1`` to open the gate;
    * ``SPEC_KITTY_SAAS_URL=http://localhost:1`` so the rehydrate fails
      fast and emits the structured warning;
    * ``PYTHONPATH`` pinned to the worktree's ``src/`` so the
      subprocess loads the in-tree package, not a stray system install.

    The mission-create command additionally requires a git repo on a
    real branch and a ``.kittify/`` skeleton in CWD. Rather than running
    the heavyweight ``spec-kitty init`` (which prompts for charter
    input), we build the minimum scaffold in ``tmp_path`` via
    ``_scaffold_minimal_kittify_repo``: ``git init`` + empty seed
    commit + bare ``.kittify/config.yaml`` + ``kitty-specs/`` directory.

    Contract assertions:

    * ``returncode == 0`` (FR-010: local command must succeed even when
      sync ingress is skipped);
    * ``json.loads(stdout)`` succeeds (NFR-003 / AC-006);
    * parsed payload has ``result == "success"`` and a
      ``mission_slug`` field, proving the mission was actually created;
    * stderr contains the structured ``direct ingress skipped`` warning
      OR the ``direct_ingress_missing_private_team`` category, proving
      the diagnostic path actually fired;
    * stdout contains NO ``Connection failed`` prose (FR-009).
