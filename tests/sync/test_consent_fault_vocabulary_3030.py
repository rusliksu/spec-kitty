"""One fault vocabulary, one meaning per token, across both producers (#3030 C-003).

The two modules that mint :class:`ConfigReadFault` used the same tokens for different
states, one module apart::

    sync/config.py    TOML syntax error      -> "unparseable"
                      OSError                -> "unreadable"
    sync/consent.py   open-OR-parse failure  -> "unreadable"
                      non-mapping top level  -> "unparseable"

So ``unreadable`` meant *could not open* on one surface and *could not open or parse*
on the other, and ``unparseable`` meant *bad syntax* on one and *parsed fine, wrong
shape* on the other. That is the "two representations of one invariant" C-003 forbids,
and it had already produced a false operator message: ``sync doctor`` advised *"it
parsed, but its top level is not a mapping"* over a ``not valid TOML`` fault. **That
wrong text passed the suite**, because an ``or`` across two acceptable wordings let
either satisfy the assertion. Nothing below spans two acceptable strings: each case
asserts the one correct token.

**Four kinds, not three.** The states are distinguished by the operator action that
resolves each, and no two of them share one:

===================================  ===============  ==========================
state                                token            what the operator does
===================================  ===============  ==========================
cannot be opened                     ``unreadable``   fix mode/ownership
opened, syntax does not parse        ``unparseable``  repair the syntax
parsed, top level is not a mapping   ``wrong_shape``  make the document a mapping
right shape, a value is unusable     ``unusable``     correct that field's value
===================================  ===============  ==========================

Collapsing the first two — the old ``consent.py`` reading — is what forced the doctor's
``unreadable`` advice to hedge ("a permission error means fix the mode; a parse error
means repair the syntax"), i.e. to be half wrong for every reader. Collapsing the
middle two — the old ``config.py`` reading of ``unparseable`` versus ``consent.py``'s —
is the divergence itself.

``config.py`` keeps both of its existing tokens with their existing meanings, because
they were already the coherent pair; ``consent.py`` moves onto them. ``config.py`` mints
no ``wrong_shape``: TOML's top level is a table by construction, so ``toml.load`` cannot
return a non-mapping and a branch for it would be unreachable code asserting a state
that cannot occur.
