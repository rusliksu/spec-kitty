"""A non-mutating endpoint's response may never be recorded as a delivery.

#3722. `import-history --apply` runs in two phases: it preflights every chunk
before uploading any. `_preflight_classification` recorded an accepted preflight
as ``DELIVERED``, so a run that was half-way through phase one reported
thousands of events "delivered" that the server did not have and might never
receive. Observed live: 15,405 preflight attempts all recorded ``delivered``,
zero ``history_upload`` attempts, zero events on the server.

The original shortcut was deliberate and its reasoning was sound -- the ledger
needs a *terminal* state or a re-run crashes recovering a perpetually
nonterminal attempt (`_exact_terminal_history` admits only TERMINAL or ABSENT).
What was wrong was the word. ``PREFLIGHT_ACCEPTED`` keeps the terminality and
drops the false claim.

These tests pin the property in both directions: the classification must not
emit DELIVERED, and the resume path must still accept what it emits.
