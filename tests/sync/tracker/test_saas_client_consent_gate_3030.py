"""FR-029: the tracker SaaS transport must not ship a non-consenting project (#3030).

The 2026-07-27 incident delivered 1,322 events belonging to five never-opted-in
projects. In this product a ``mission_slug`` **is a client engagement name**, so
shipping one is itself the confidentiality breach rather than incidental
metadata.

``tracker/saas_client.py`` was gated on authentication and ``X-Team-Slug`` only;
``project_uuid`` appeared nowhere in the module. Ten endpoints, three of them
POSTs carrying ``mission_slug`` / ``project_slug`` / ``mission_id`` / the external
issue ``title``.

**Everything here asserts at the transport.** The recorded requests are searched
for the engagement name — in the body *and* in the URL — rather than checking
that some boolean flipped. A gate that returns the right verdict while the bytes
still leave the machine is not a fix, and this mission has already found a pin
that passed with the invariant stripped entirely.

Two properties every refusal test relies on and one of them states outright:

* **Auth is satisfied throughout.** The token and team-slug bridges are stubbed
  to succeed, so a refusal can only come from the consent gate. The incident was
  carried by a correctly authenticated client with a correct team header.
* **A positive control transmits.** Without one, "no requests recorded" is
  equally consistent with a harness that never wired the transport at all.

    ``SaaSTrackerClient(r)`` is **matched and flagged unattributed**. The tracker
    constructor is ``(sync_config=None, *, project_root=None, timeout=30.0)`` —
    ``project_root`` is **keyword-only**, and the sole positional slot is
    ``sync_config``. A bare positional therefore does not merely spell the root
    differently: it binds a *different parameter* and leaves ``_project_root``
    ``None``, producing a client that refuses every request. Reading it as
    attributed would bless a call the class cannot honour.

    **Why it needs its own witness.** All three live sites pass
    ``project_root=``, so nothing in the corpus is a bare positional, and neither
    witness above reds if ``bool(node.args)`` is added to the attribution test:

    * SC-012 pins ``SaaSTrackerClient(repo_root=r)`` — no positional args, so it
      stays unattributed and stays green.
    * SC-013 pins ``mod.SaaSTrackerClient(project_root=r)`` — already attributed.
    * The corpus scan cannot move: ``scanned`` stays at 3 and ``unattributed``
      stays empty, because no live site is positional.

    ``bool(node.args)`` is not a hypothetical edit: it is *correct* in the SaaS
    predicate, where ``from_env`` really does thread the root positionally. Copying
    that clause across while "harmonising" the two predicates is the selective
    widening this pins — the naive unification is already caught by SC-012.

    **No non-match is asserted here**, for the reason given in the SaaS
