"""Acceptance harness for tracker egress refusal (Mission `tracker-egress-refusal-3108-01KYWF1R`).

Stage 1 of the Mission (`plan.md`): this file is the whole deliverable of WP01, and it is
committed **before** any product code lands (WP03/WP04/WP05). Per the charter's ATDD rule, the
refusing pins in this file are RED on purpose, on the un-gated tree, until those later work
packages land the Channel-2 (`tracker.egress`) gate. Only the positive/consenting controls and the
harness's own non-vacuity checks are required to pass at this stage. See ``## Definition of Done``
in ``WP01-acceptance-harness.md`` for the exact exit criterion; a reviewer applying a blanket
"the suite must be green" rule to this file is applying the wrong rule to this WP.

Four independent mechanisms have been measured to produce a green refusal test with **no gate
built at all** (FR-018). Every fixture in this file defeats all four simultaneously:

* **H1 -- ownership mode.** Every fixture pins ``doctrine: {mode: spec_kitty_authoritative}``.
  Under the default ``external_authoritative``, a *consenting* push captures only
  ``['<cmd>', '--json', 'list']`` -- the sentinel never reaches ``create``.
* **H2 -- injection point.** The recorder *is* a real ``#!``-script on disk, named through the
  machine-global tracker credential file (the same path ``factory.py``'s ``build_connector``
  reads). ``SubprocessCommandRunner`` is not exported from ``spec_kitty_tracker.__all__`` and
  ``build_connector`` passes no runner, so there is no injection seam to patch, and none of
  ``_build_engine`` / ``build_connector`` / ``SyncEngine`` / ``LocalTrackerService`` /
  ``TrackerService`` are patched anywhere in this file (SC-020 pin below).
* **H3 -- arming.** Every fixture sets ``SPEC_KITTY_ENABLE_SAAS_SYNC=1`` explicitly (never
  inherited) and every refusal assertion checks refusal **text**, never a bare exit code, plus a
  negative pin (US1 sc3) proving the un-armed abort message is not what matched.
* **H8 -- the store is seeded.** Every push/run fixture seeds the tracker store with the sentinel
  issue via ``asyncio.run(store.upsert_issue(...))`` *before* the command runs -- an empty store
  never reaches ``create_issue`` (``SyncEngine.push`` iterates ``store.list_issues`` first).

Hazard 7 (this directory's own autouse fixture) -- read before touching the US5 (hosted) tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``tests/sync/tracker/conftest.py`` defines an ``autouse=True`` fixture that patches
``saas_client._fetch_access_token_sync`` to whatever ``mock_credential_store`` fixture the test
file defines, falling back to a ``MagicMock`` returning ``"test-access-token"`` when no such
fixture exists. Left unneutralised, every hosted control in this file would sail past the token
check into a real ``httpx`` call and trip the HTTP trip-wire -- which would misread as a gate. This
file defines its own ``mock_credential_store`` fixture below, whose ``get_access_token()`` returns
``None``, restoring the real ``No valid access token`` base behaviour the US5 controls are written
against (re-derived and quoted from inside this directory, per T007's validation clause).

Why the hosted (US5) cells construct ``TrackerService`` / ``SaaSTrackerService`` directly instead
of going through ``typer.testing.CliRunner`` -- a recorded DEPARTURE, not a resolution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``plan.md`` Stage 5 instructs that SC-005 and SC-005a's hosted-destination cells "run end to end
through the CLI." This file's US5 cells do **not** do that, and this is recorded here as an
enlarged residual against that clause (see also ``research.md`` / plan.md §7.3's open items),
not as something this WP resolved.

Measured: ``spec_kitty tracker sync push`` / ``list-tickets --provider jira`` on a SaaS-backed
binding calls ``_check_sync_readiness`` / ``_check_readiness``, whose auth probe
(``saas.readiness._probe_auth``) asks ``get_token_manager().is_authenticated`` -- a *different*,
process-wide authentication signal, wholly orthogonal to the tracker-egress consent gate this
Mission is about. In an isolated ``HOME`` that probe is always ``False``, so a literal CLI
invocation is rejected at ``MISSING_AUTH`` (``"No SaaS authentication token is present."``) before
ever reaching ``TrackerService``, ``SaaSTrackerService`` or ``SaaSTrackerClient._request`` --
the exact code this Mission's gate lives in and around. Faking that unrelated auth signal (e.g.
patching ``get_token_manager``) to force a CLI run through is a bigger and less honest patch than
simply constructing the real, un-mocked ``TrackerService`` / ``SaaSTrackerService`` the CLI command
itself would have constructed, and calling its real method. Neither class is in the H2 patch-site
prohibition list (that list is about not *stubbing out* ``_build_engine`` /
``SyncEngine`` / etc. -- it says nothing against constructing the real classes directly). Every
hosted assertion in this file therefore exercises real, unpatched ``TrackerService`` /
``SaaSTrackerService`` / ``SaaSTrackerClient`` code, from the same entry point the CLI command
would have reached it from, one layer below the CLI's own readiness pre-flight -- sound as far as
it goes, but it is **not** "end to end through the CLI" and must not be described as satisfying
that clause. A follow-up issue is tracked for ``saas.readiness._probe_auth`` blocking hosted
tracker CLI acceptance coverage; this file's US5 coverage is honestly **resolved-negative** on
the CLI-literal reading of Stage 5, and **resolved-positive** only one layer below it. The
*local* (US1-4) cells carry no such gap -- ``_check_sync_readiness`` short-circuits entirely for
a local binding via ``_is_local_binding()`` -- and are run through the real CLI via ``CliRunner``,
so Stage 5's "through the CLI" clause is fully satisfied there.

Scope decision recorded for T006 step 2 (the bind counters)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Both bind-counter patch targets (``specify_cli.tracker.local_service.tracker_egress_verdict`` and
``specify_cli.tracker.saas_client.tracker_egress_verdict``) do not exist on the un-gated base --
WP04/WP05 land the names. Installing a delegating wrapper against a name that does not exist
raises ``AttributeError`` at *install* time, which **is** the committed red T006 describes:
*"Until WP04 and WP05 land there is no name to wrap at either target ... let those assertions be
part of the committed red."* This file wires each counter once, against a representative refusing
cell per destination (``test_local_bind_counter_wired_against_named_target`` /
``test_hosted_bind_counter_wired_against_named_target``), rather than duplicating the wrapper
install in all thirteen refusing cells -- duplicating an assertion that fails identically (and for
the identical reason -- the target does not exist) thirteen times adds no additional evidence and
makes the primary leak-focused assertions in each cell harder to read. Once WP04/WP05 land, extend
those two representative tests' cell coverage per T006's own table; do not delete them.

US1 sc4's exemption (T006/T007): **no bind counter is asserted** in the hosted-sync queue-drain
cell (``test_us1_sc4_hosted_drain_unaffected_by_tracker_key`` below). Neither the local nor the
hosted ``tracker_egress_verdict`` name is ever called on that path -- it is the hosted body/event
drain (``BackgroundSyncService.drain_body_uploads_only``), a different transport with its own,
unrelated consent chain, and this Mission changes nothing about it.

POSIX scope (Hazard 6)
-----------------------
The recorder is a ``#!``-script made executable via ``chmod``, and ``subprocess.run`` is invoked
with no shell. Windows would need a ``.cmd``/``.bat`` sibling this Mission has no runner to prove,
so the whole module is skipped on ``nt`` rather than silently claiming cross-platform coverage it
has not earned.

        """SC-007's **first** not-consentable remedy: mint an identity, *then* record Channel 1.

        Added by the mission owner after WP08 found the gap. SC-007 specifies two remedies for
        this state and this file only executed the second (the Channel-2 grant, above). The
        upgrade note documents both, and WP08's rule is that a documented remedy must have an
        executed-remedy test behind it -- so WP08 proved this one with a scratch probe rather
        than document an unverified claim, and reported it instead of editing this approved
        file. This is that proof, committed.

        It matters more than a coverage tick. The shipped hosted refusal text points an
        identity-less operator at ``spec-kitty sync opt-in``, which **cannot work** without a
        project identity -- ``enable_checkout_sync`` raises ``ConsentIdentityUnresolvedError``.
        The order here (identity first, then consent) is the only Channel-1 route out of this
        state, and it is what the note tells operators to do.

        ``ensure_identity`` is the call ``spec-kitty init`` makes; driving it directly keeps the
        cell about the remedy rather than about ``init``'s unrelated scaffolding.

    ``BackgroundSyncService.drain_body_uploads_only`` (``sync/background.py:490-512``) consults
    only ``is_saas_sync_enabled()`` and the uuid-keyed consent index -- it never reads a repo

    guard: it covers only a **cwd-shaped** regression (a future reader of ``Path.cwd()``, which is
    what ``chdir`` into each arm's root would catch); ``background.py:284-286`` records that a
    cwd-derived consent answer *is* the defect this Mission's siblings have already found, so a
    tracker-key regression on this transport would more plausibly key on
    ``_drain_checkout_roots()`` than on cwd -- a shape this cell does not simulate and would not

# it was asserted only structurally (a call-site census showing 6 `tracker_egress_verdict`
# call expressions across 5 enclosing functions, none of them an ungated command). A census is
# re-derived by hand and goes stale; these cells run the commands.
#
# Every cell here carries an **in-cell discriminator** (`_assert_gate_is_live`): the same
# repo root that serves the ungated command must first refuse `tracker sync pull`, naming
# Channel 2. Without it a cell would stay green on a fixture that was never refusing at all --
# "the ungated commands work on a project with no gate" is not the claim.
#
# Each cell asserts the command **succeeded and returned its expected local-only payload**,
# never merely "did not print the refusal". A command that exits 1 for an unrelated reason
# (missing binary, missing auth, absent config) must not be able to satisfy these.


#: The exact Channel-2 refusal `_refused_message` composes at ``LOCAL_SUBPROCESS`` for a
#: committed ``tracker: {egress: refused}``. Quoted, not paraphrased: a cell that asserted
#: only ``exit_code != 0`` would be satisfied by the un-armed abort (US1 sc3's negative pin).

#: here binds a LOCAL provider, and ``_check_sync_readiness``'s own verdict call sits on the

#: purely for completeness (it is asserted at 0 in both cells below, the same way

    host-config both resolve, that call issues a real ``urllib.request.urlopen`` HEAD probe

    ``SaaSTrackerClient._request``'s own Channel-1/Channel-2 ``tracker_egress_verdict`` gate
