"""FR-014 dashboard-typed-contracts regression test.

Runs the committed ``baseline/capture.py`` script against the current tree
(post-WP03 code) and asserts byte-identical JSON against the committed
``baseline/pre-wp23-dashboard-typed.json`` anchor.

If this test fails, WP03's T019 dashboard rewire changed typed-contract
semantics. The bar is byte-identical; do NOT loosen the comparison.
Fix the rewire instead.
