"""Self-test for the shared non-vacuity examined-floor guard (#3273) and the
diff-scope git resolver (#3147, B-WP02).

``related_validator.validate_related`` and
``relative_link_fixer.check_dead_body_links`` both route their "examined
count fell below the floor" ``RuntimeError`` through
``scripts.docs._guards.assert_examined_floor``. These tests exercise the
helper directly so its branches — below-floor raise, at/above-floor no-raise,
and the ``gate``/``noun``/``fr_id``/``extra`` parameterization surfacing in
the message — are covered independently of either caller.

The second half exercises :func:`scripts.docs._guards.resolve_changed_files`,
the shared diff-scope resolver both blocking docs gates' ``--changed-from``
mode is built on. **B-WP02 is the load-bearing distinction pinned here:**
fail-closed keys on git base RESOLVABILITY (a non-zero ``git`` return code),
never on the resolved changed-set being empty.
