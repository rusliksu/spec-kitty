"""Tests for the redirect-stub generator + coverage gate (FR-006, NFR-002).

Covers the three contract guarantees from ``contracts/redirect-stub.md``:

* **derivation** — the redirect map is derived single-writer from the baseline +
  ``moves:`` spine and matches the committed ``redirect_map.yaml`` (diff-stable);
* **emit + no-404** — ``generate`` writes ``<meta refresh>`` stubs at the old paths
  and refuses to emit a stub whose target is a 404;
* **coverage goes RED on a gap** — a baseline URL with neither a live page nor a
  live-target stub appears in ``uncovered`` (the NFR-002 gate has teeth), and the
  check is non-vacuous against an empty baseline.

Fixtures use realistic published-URL shapes (``3x/index.html``,
``context/charter-overview.html``, ``tutorials/getting-started.html``).
