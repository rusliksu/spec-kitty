"""Self-test for the ``audience:`` frontmatter resolver (WP02 / IC-01 / FR-003).

The resolver validates that every ``audience:`` reference (a ``.md`` value,
scalar **or** in a list) points at an existing persona file under
``docs/context/audience/``, while leaving not-yet-migrated *free-text* values
alone. This self-test is the real Definition of Done: a ruler that cannot go
RED is fake. We therefore prove that

* a deliberately-**dangling** ``audience:`` reference is detected (and reds
  under ``--strict``);
* a clean tree of resolvable references reports **no** dangling refs;
* a walk that examines **zero** ``audience:`` values reds on the non-vacuity
  floor rather than passing vacuously; and
* not-yet-migrated **free-text** values are examined but never dangle.
