"""Tests for the published-page-set resolver (``scripts/docs/_published_pages.py``).

The resolver exists because "which source pages are published" had two answers —
``docs/docfx.json`` and a hardcoded glob list in ``tests/docs/test_docs_seo.py``
— that silently diverged, leaving the SEO gate guarding 16 of 674 pages.

Two families of assertion carry the weight here:

* **Membership, not reasoning** — DocFX glob semantics differ from ``pathlib``
  semantics, and a mistranslation under-collects silently. So the translation is
  proved by asserting that specific, known live pages are members
  (:func:`test_live_tree_membership`), never by arguing about globs.
* **The regression proof** —
  :func:`test_would_have_caught_the_original_regression` replays the retired
  pre-move glob list against the live tree and asserts the resolver refuses it.
  It encodes *this specific historical failure* so a future reorganisation
  cannot reproduce it silently.

Small synthetic trees would trip the non-vacuity floor, so the shared fixture
builds a tree comfortably above :data:`MINIMUM_EXPECTED_PAGES`. That keeps the
resolver's public surface exactly as contracted — there is deliberately no
"skip the floor" parameter, because such a parameter would be a code path that
returns a degraded set.
