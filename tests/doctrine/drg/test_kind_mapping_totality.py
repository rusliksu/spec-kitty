"""Totality guard for module-level dict tables keyed by ArtifactKind/NodeKind.

WP07 / T029-T030 (C-005, FR-012). This module supersedes the narrower subset
guard in ``test_nodekind_artifactkind.py::test_node_kind_remains_superset_of_artifact_kind``
(kept for its own regression value; not duplicated here).

Rationale: every time a new :class:`~doctrine.artifact_kinds.ArtifactKind` /
:class:`~doctrine.drg.models.NodeKind` member is added (this mission added
``TEMPLATE`` and ``ASSET``), any module-level dict table keyed by one of these
enums silently becomes a trap for the *next* new kind unless it is either:

1. **Total** -- an entry for every enum member, so a missing key is a
   ``KeyError`` (or, worse, a caught-and-swallowed bug) rather than a
   compile-time fact anyone can check; or
2. **An explicitly allow-listed `.get`-defaulted partial** -- every call site
   reads it via ``.get(kind, <safe-default>)``, so an absent key is a
   deliberate, safe fallback rather than an oversight.

Naive totality ("every such dict must have every key") is provably wrong: it
false-fails on four pre-existing, legitimately-partial tables
(``charter.kind_vocabulary::_ID_FIELD_BY_KIND``/``_PROJECT_KIND_DIRS`` and
``charter.pack_manager::_ID_FIELD_BY_KIND``/``_PROJECT_KIND_DIRS``). This guard
distinguishes the two cases via :data:`_EXEMPT_GET_PARTIALS`, an explicit
allow-list keyed by ``"<dotted.module>::<CONSTANT_NAME>"`` -- the exemption
mechanism chosen over an inline marker comment because it puts the entire
partial-tables surface in one auditable place (this file) rather than
scattered across the tree.
