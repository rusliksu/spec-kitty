"""Unit tests for the canonical built-in-graph seam (WP03, mission #2680).

``load_built_in_graph`` / ``built_in_graph_source`` are the single accessor
every source reader of the shipped DRG must route through. Routing every reader
to the *directory* is what let WP05 delete the ``src/doctrine/graph.yaml``
monolith and flip all consumers to ``*.graph.yaml`` fragments with no
call-site edits — this test locks in the post-flip sharded layout.
