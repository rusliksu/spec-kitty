"""Golden round-trip ratchet for the WP-authoring frontmatter contract (#2220 + #2221).

The WP-frontmatter ownership contract is encoded in three independent places that
historically drifted apart:

1. Doctrine prose — BOTH ``tasks/guidelines.md`` copies (the ``actions/`` runtime
   copy and the ``mission-steps/`` step-contract copy).
2. The authoring template — ``software-dev/templates/task-prompt-template.md``
   frontmatter.
3. The ownership validator — ``specify_cli.ownership.validation`` whose
   ``_CODE_PREFIXES = ("src/", "tests/")`` is **repo-root-relative**.

Per C-004 the *code* (the validator) is the single source of authority for the
path shape: ``owned_files`` must be **repo-root-relative**, never absolute. This
module is the SSOT ratchet that locks the prose and template to that authority so
they cannot silently re-diverge:

- A mandatory prose ratchet pins BOTH ``guidelines.md`` copies to repo-root-relative
  guidance and forbids the literal ``absolute path`` drift vector.
- A golden round-trip drives the REAL ownership validator + finalize resolve path
  (read from the on-disk template, not a hand-written fixture): a WP authored with
  repo-relative ``owned_files`` passes; an absolute-path entry fails consistently.
