"""Integration: ``tests/contract/`` is a hard mission-review gate (FR-023).

WP05 of mission ``stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04-01KQ4ARB``
implements FR-023 by codifying the policy that mission acceptance is
gated on a green ``pytest tests/contract/`` run. The mission-review
skill's instructions wire the gate operationally; this test pins the
gate's correctness contract:

- A green contract suite produces exit code 0 (gate passes).
- A red contract suite produces a non-zero exit code (gate FAILS).
- The gate is invoked via the same one-liner the skill documents,
  so an operator copy-pasting from the runbook hits the same code path.

The "red" branch is exercised against an isolated synthetic test file in
``tmp_path`` -- we never inject a real failing test into the live suite.
