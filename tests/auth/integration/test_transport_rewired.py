"""Structural regression test: every legacy transport file is rewired.

Verifies that the rewire done in WP08/WP09/WP10 stuck and that no future
refactor accidentally reintroduces the deleted ``specify_cli.sync.auth``
module or its ``AuthClient`` / ``CredentialStore`` classes.

This is a non-runtime test: it uses :mod:`inspect` to read source files
and asserts the presence of :func:`get_token_manager` imports and the
absence of legacy class references.

FR coverage: FR-016 (TokenManager is sole credential surface), FR-017
(HTTP callers must obtain tokens from TokenManager).

Test isolation: this file does not drive the CLI directly, but it is
grouped under ``tests/auth/integration/`` because it enforces the same
structural contract as the CliRunner-based tests.
