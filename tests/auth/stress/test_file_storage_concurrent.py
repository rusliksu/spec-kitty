"""Stress test for :class:`FileFallbackStorage` atomicity (WP11 T062).

Concurrently issues many writes and reads against the encrypted file
fallback backend and asserts that:

1. No write produces a corrupted file (every subsequent ``read()``
   returns a valid :class:`StoredSession`, not ``None`` due to a
   half-written JSON blob).
2. The final state is a well-formed session from one of the writers
   (last-writer-wins semantics — not a blended/torn record).
3. No :class:`Exception` escapes from the concurrent workers.

Implementation notes:

- Uses a tmp_path-scoped ``FileFallbackStorage`` so no production
  ``~/.spec-kitty/auth`` directory is touched.
- Subclasses the production storage to drop the scrypt cost parameters
  to the floor (``N=2**10``) so 20+ encrypt operations complete in
  under a second. This is ONLY a test-speed hack — the file format,
  locking, and atomic-rename semantics are identical to production.
- Uses ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` rather than asyncio because the real
  atomic-write contract is defended by :class:`filelock.FileLock`
  (a thread-level lock), and that is exactly what we want to stress.
