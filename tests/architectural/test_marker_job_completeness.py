"""Marker->job completeness invariant (FR-001, mission ci-suite-map-bind WP04).

Every marker registered in ``pytest.ini`` must occupy exactly one of three CI
states, so the documented authoring-default marker (``unit``) — and every other
registered marker — can never be silently CI-invisible (#2034 root cause):

  (i)   ROUTED-BY-MARKER  — positively referenced (negation-aware token walk via
        pytest's own ``Expression``) by >=1 gate's ``-m`` expression across the
        four suite-running workflows. Verified collection-free.
  (ii)  ROUTED-BY-PATH    — every collected test carrying the marker is selected
        by >=1 gate. VERIFIED against the ``_gate_coverage`` orphan model (a
        marker with even one orphan carrier is NOT routed-by-path).
  (iii) CI_INVISIBLE       — a reasoned allowlist entry for a genuinely-unrun
        marker (zero collected carriers). Every entry carries a non-empty reason
        (C-003) and must be REGISTERED (reverse containment).

``unit`` and ``contract`` are HARD-ASSERTED ROUTED-BY-MARKER: ineligible for
(ii) and (iii). The allowlist path is written so it can never absorb them
(renata MEDIUM-3 — otherwise the ledger could hide the exact hole the mission
closes).

Honest three-state split (re-derived live at implement, 2026-07-04, NFR-004;
37 registered markers; `_gate_coverage.load_gates()` + `collect_universe()`):

  ROUTED-BY-MARKER (11): architectural, contract, fast, git_repo, integration,
      quarantine, regression, slow, timing, unit, windows_ci
      (`quarantine` is routed by the NON-BLOCKING `quarantine-visibility` gate —
      the spec's documented edge case: a job selects it, so it is ROUTED;
      blocking-ness is a separate axis. Its held-out population is governed by
      #2295/#2309 (17) + #2342 (`test_200_missions_under_5s`) and is never
      hard-pinned here. `regression` is routed by marker to the `-m regression`
      gate `regression-tests`, which — unlike `quarantine-visibility` — is
      BLOCKING (a member of `quality-gate.needs`): a red-first P0 reproduction
      is expected to red mainline and, because CI is the release authority, must
      gate releases; a non-blocking regression lane would fake green on P0s
      (#2772-family course-correction of the #2774 visibility-only design). Its
      orphan carriers by path — e.g. `tests/delivery/` reaches no path gate —
      make an explicit `-m regression` job their required CI home rather than a
      silent CI_INVISIBLE entry.)
  ROUTED-BY-PATH (13): adversarial, agent, asyncio, distribution, doctrine,
      e2e, no_git_tmp_path, no_readiness_stub, non_sandbox,
      requires_symlinks, stress, timeout, upgrade
      (each has >=1 collected carrier and ZERO orphan carriers — verified via
      the orphan model; NOT hand-asserted. The spec's illustrative
      `non_sandbox`/`timeout`/`asyncio`/`stress` invisible-guesses were
      SUPERSEDED by this live derivation: their carriers all reach a path gate,
      so they are routed-by-path, not invisible — shrink-preferred, C-003.)
  CI_INVISIBLE (13): the ``CI_INVISIBLE`` ledger below — markers with ZERO
      collected carriers today (reserved/opt-out markers no gate selects).

The name-level completeness here is complementary to the set-level orphan
ratchet (``test_gate_coverage.py``): that pins every test's marker SET reaches a
gate; this pins every registered marker NAME has a routing home (Decision 4).
