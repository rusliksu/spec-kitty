"""Gate 3 (FR-003/FR-007, WP09): no module outside ``src/charter/**`` or
``src/doctrine/**`` imports ``doctrine.resolver`` directly.

Mission ``charter-sole-door-bypass-closure-01KZ3WAA``, WP09 / T039. Third of the
three mission-wide durability gates this work package ships.

**This gate is a forward-looking regression guard, NOT proof of a closure.**
The WP09 prompt is explicit about this, and so is the post-tasks squad
correction that produced it: an earlier draft claimed "WP05 closed the one real
consumer", which is false — *nothing* outside ``src/charter/**`` ever imported
``doctrine.resolver``. There was no violation to close, so this module must not
be read, cited, or summarised as evidence that this mission eliminated a bypass.
What it does is make the currently-clean state *durable*: the moment a future
consumer starts reaching around
:class:`charter.resolver.DoctrineService` into ``doctrine.resolver``'s tier
functions, this test reds.

Why the boundary matters
------------------------
``doctrine/resolver.py`` owns the 5-tier resolution chain (OVERRIDE > LEGACY >
GLOBAL_MISSION > GLOBAL > PACKAGE_DEFAULT) plus ``resolve_mission``. The mission
contract (``contracts/charter-doctrine-service-contract.md``) pins that every
tier and the mission-config resolution "remains reachable ONLY via a method on
[``charter.resolver.DoctrineService``] from outside ``src/charter/**``".
``doctrine/resolver.py``'s functions are the implementation those methods
delegate to. A direct import from a consumer re-opens exactly the second,
ungated resolution path FR-003 exists to prevent — ``charter/resolver.py``'s own
comment marks its import as "the ONLY import of ``doctrine.resolver``'s tier
functions".

Consumers that need the resolution *types* (``ResolutionResult`` /
``ResolutionTier``) already have a sanctioned route: the
``charter.resolution`` facade, which re-exports them by identity (proven by
``test_charter_facades_reexport_doctrine.py``). ``specify_cli/runtime/resolver.py``
is the live example, and its module docstring records why identity-preserving
re-export matters (~30 CI failures when a duplicate enum existed). So the
zero-tolerance stance costs a consumer nothing.

Zero-tolerance, no exclusions
-----------------------------
There is no allow-list (C-002) and none is expected: the live census outside the
two owning layers is empty. Adding an entry here to green a new violation is a
policy change, not a fix — route the consumer through
``charter.resolver.DoctrineService`` or the ``charter.resolution`` facade
instead.

Why this is not a duplicate of ``test_runtime_charter_doctrine_boundary.py``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That gate is deliberately narrower on all three axes, and the WP09 prompt
directs not re-asserting what an adjacent gate already proves:

* **Scope** — it audits ``src/runtime/**`` (plus ``src/specify_cli/doctrine/``);
  this one audits *all* of ``src/`` outside the two owning layers.
* **Depth** — its ``_module_imports_doctrine_directly`` inspects **module-level**
  imports only (its own docstring says so). This gate walks every scope, so a
  function-local or ``try``/``except``-nested import is caught. spec.md FR-001
  notes that same module-level-only limitation is why the "boundary ratchet"
  concern at the ``tasks_status_cmd.py`` sites was a red herring — the real
  violations in this codebase are function-local.
* **Tolerance** — it carries a shrink-only allow-list of pre-existing sites;
  this gate has none.
* **Target** — it bans ``doctrine.*`` broadly for runtime modules; this one bans
  the single ``doctrine.resolver`` module for everyone, including
  ``specify_cli`` modules that the other gate does not audit at all.

A5 fix: ``from package import module`` also binds the guarded module
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adversarial-review injection probes measured this gate at a 4/9 real catch
rate. The dominant miss: ``from doctrine import resolver`` — in all three
spellings (plain, aliased, function-local) — fully evaded the ban. For an
``ast.ImportFrom`` the detector tested only ``node.module`` (``"doctrine"``);
it never tried ``node.module + "." + alias.name``. But ``from doctrine import
resolver`` binds the IDENTICAL module object as ``import doctrine.resolver``,
and ``resolver.resolve_template(...)`` then re-opens the exact ungated second
resolution path this gate exists to forbid. :func:`scan_file_resolver_imports`
now extends its candidate dotted-name list with the package-qualified form for
every ``ImportFrom`` name, closing all three spellings in one change (see
:func:`test_injected_from_package_import_module_is_flagged` and
:func:`test_injected_aliased_from_package_import_is_flagged`).
