"""Fixture: a lazy ``doctrine`` import inside a nested function body.

The lazy-import ratchet MUST flag this file. A function-body (or deeper) direct
``from doctrine…`` import is exactly the reach-through the sibling ratchet
exists to catch: invisible to the module-level ratchet, yet a real runtime
dependency the moment the enclosing function runs. This file is parsed via
``ast.parse``; it is never imported, so the lazy import never resolves.
