"""Governance-as-test: built-in DRG overrides must be sanctioned by the repo.

The three-layer merge (:mod:`doctrine.drg.merge`) PERMITS a same-kind org node
to override a built-in node in place (recorded as a ``node_override`` conflict
with ``resolution_applied == "org_override"`` and a warning). The merge does
NOT decide whether *this* repo sanctions a given override — that is a per-repo
governance decision expressed in ``.kittify/doctrine/replaceable-builtins.yaml``.

This architectural test loads the repo's built-in graph plus any configured
org/project fragments, runs the live merge, and asserts that every built-in
URN that ends up overridden by an org node is on the repo's allowlist. A
built-in **directive** override additionally requires a non-empty reason.

With no overrides authored in this repo, the test passes vacuously (this repo
authors none — its built-in graph is unchanged and no org pack overrides it).
The adjudication logic (:func:`find_unsanctioned_overrides`) is pure and
reusable so a consumer repo can re-run the same governance gate.
