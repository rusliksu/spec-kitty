"""Doctrine reach-through census gate (mission doctrine-public-api-surface, WP01).

This module is the **authoritative, machine-readable disposition manifest** for the
doctrine public-API-surface mission. It is deliberately self-contained: WP02's
INTERNAL-negative test and WP04's lazy-import ratchet baseline import the constants
below directly rather than re-deriving a classification (or re-reading prose from
``data-model.md`` that can silently drift from what the tests enforce)::

    from tests.architectural.test_doctrine_census import (
        DISPOSITION,
        EXEMPT_MANAGEMENT_SURFACE,
        TICKETED_BASELINE,
        reached_doctrine_paths,
    )

The census is **re-run against the live tree** on every invocation (an AST sweep of
``src/specify_cli/`` excluding the exempt ``src/specify_cli/doctrine/`` management
subpackage) — the disposition table is not trusted from a stale snapshot. A newly
reach-through-ed, undoored doctrine path therefore fails CI (FR-002 / SC-002).

Census numbers, re-measured on this tip (post WP05–WP07 migration) via
``reached_doctrine_paths()`` — the same live scan the gate runs on every invocation:

* module-level direct ``from doctrine …`` imports (``ImportFrom.level == 0``): **0**
* lazy (function-body) direct doctrine imports: **4 files / 5 reaches**
* ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` doctrine imports (excluded from the reach-through set): 11 files
* distinct doctrine module-paths reached (non-TYPE_CHECKING): **4**

(Earlier snapshots recorded 29 files / 54 lines / 23 paths before the WP05–WP07
migration, and 34 files / 70 lines / 26 paths at planning time — both superseded.
The gate re-censuses the live tree every run, so it, not this prose, is the
authority; reproduce the numbers above with ``reached_doctrine_paths()``.)

See ``kitty-specs/doctrine-public-api-surface-01KZPDSR/data-model.md`` for the finalized
per-symbol disposition table and the management-surface / C-007-mission notes.
