"""Wheel-packaging groundwork closure for the nested ``src/doctrine`` package.

Mission ``doctrine-charter-split-unification-01KZ0SRB``, WP12 (FR-009,
FR-010, NFR-004, C-002).

The nested ``src/doctrine/pyproject.toml`` describes a standalone
``spec-kitty-doctrine`` wheel that is **not** built by any CI job today
(C-002 forbids that this WP wire it into the release/build path). This
module asserts the *shape* of that nested package definition:

1. **FR-009** -- a sibling ``spec-kitty-kernel`` package exists at
   ``src/kernel/pyproject.toml`` with **zero** first-party dependencies
   (the true root of the wheel dependency chain: ``kernel <- doctrine <-
   charter <- specify_cli``).
2. **FR-010** -- ``src/doctrine/pyproject.toml`` declares a dependency on
   ``spec-kitty-kernel`` (the real import-closure need: ``resolver.py``,
   ``missions/primitives.py``, and ``shared/schema_utils.py`` all import
   from ``kernel``).
3. **FR-010 / D7** -- the chosen out-of-tree mechanism that carries the
   repo-root sibling ``packs/`` directory into the nested doctrine wheel
   as a ``doctrine`` site-packages sibling (the hatchling custom build
   hook at ``src/doctrine/hatch_build.py``) is present and wired via
   ``[tool.hatch.build.hooks.custom]``.

NFR-004 self-mutation proof: each assertion below is written so that
removing the corresponding piece of groundwork (the kernel dependency
line, or the build-hook wiring) turns the test red. This was verified
manually during implementation by temporarily reverting each piece and
confirming failure before restoring; see WP12 report for the transcript.

C-002 guard: this module intentionally does **not** invoke ``hatch
build`` -- doing so from a generic test run would imply CI builds the
nested wheel standalone, which C-002 forbids this mission. The *real*
``hatch build`` execution and wheel-content verification is done once,
by hand, during WP12 implementation and recorded in
``research.md`` §D7; this test only pins the durable pyproject/build-hook
*shape* that made that build succeed.
