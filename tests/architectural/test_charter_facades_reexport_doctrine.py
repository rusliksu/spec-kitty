"""Architectural guard — charter facades re-export doctrine symbols by identity.

Each facade module under ``src/charter/`` that exists to proxy a doctrine
surface MUST re-export the exact doctrine object (object identity), not a
custom wrapper. This prevents a future PR from silently replacing a
re-export with a sneaky shim that drifts from doctrine.

Mission: ``charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA``.
Contract: ``kitty-specs/charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA/contracts/charter-facade-modules.md``.

The table below mirrors the contract's "Symbol tables" section. When a
facade gains a new re-export, add the (symbol, doctrine-module) tuple here.
The parametrised test then asserts (a) the symbol exists on both modules
and (b) ``facade.SYMBOL is doctrine.SYMBOL`` (object identity).
