"""Permanent guard: mission create commits meta.json after origin-binding on
the pending-origin (ticket-first) flow (squad follow-on to #2693/#2739).

DEFECT (fixed)
--------------
``_consume_pending_origin_if_present`` (step 9 of ``create_mission_core``) runs
AFTER the step-8.5 transactional scaffold commit (#2693) already landed
``meta.json``. On the ticket-first flow, a successful origin bind
(``bind_mission_origin`` -> ``set_origin_ticket`` -> ``write_meta``) then
writes the ``origin_ticket`` subtree straight to ``meta.json`` on disk — a
plain file write, not a commit. The mission-creation entry point still
reports success (``origin_binding_succeeded: True``, ``--json`` claims the
mission was created cleanly) while ``meta.json`` sits modified-uncommitted in
the working tree (``git status --porcelain`` shows ``M meta.json``).

FIX
---
After step 9, when ``origin_binding_succeeded`` is ``True``, ``meta.json`` is
re-committed through the SAME sanctioned commit surface used at step 8.5
(``_commit_feature_file``, targeting the create-time placement seam), so the
tree is clean the moment origin binding succeeds.

INVARIANT
---------
After ``create_mission_core`` returns with ``origin_binding_succeeded is
True``, ``meta.json`` carries NO uncommitted change (staged, unstaged, or
untracked) — the ticket-first flow's origin-bound metadata write is exactly
as transactionally complete as the ticket-less flow's scaffold commit.
(``spec.md`` remains intentionally uncommitted per #846 and is out of scope
for this guard.)

Drives the real production entry point ``create_mission_core`` over a real git
repository with the real ``consume_pending_origin_impl`` consumer registered;
only the outer SaaS call inside ``bind_mission_origin`` is replaced (no
network / consent-gate dependency) with a fake that performs the SAME local
write (``set_origin_ticket``) the real implementation performs after its SaaS
call succeeds — so the reproduced symptom is the real symptom, not a stand-in.

NOTE: mission-create trips the "inside a worktree" guard when the test
process itself runs from a git worktree checkout — run this file from the
PRIMARY repository checkout (not a ``.worktrees/...`` or landing worktree),
pointing ``PYTHONPATH`` at the worktree under review if the fix lives there.
