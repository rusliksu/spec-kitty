"""Hermetic fixtures for the Playwright kanban->modal e2e (issue #1008).

This is the framework-bootstrap fixture for `tests/ui/` (mission
playwright-ui-e2e-bootstrap-01KWX72W, WP01): a deterministic, synthetic
mission/WP the dashboard scanner can read, plus an in-thread dashboard boot
on an ephemeral port. No real `~/.spec-kitty`, no network, no git repo.

See docs/development/ui-e2e.md (added in WP02) for how to extend this
suite with additional dashboard e2e coverage.

# Playwright browser cache vs. per-worker HOME isolation (WP04, tests/conftest.py)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The suite's root conftest repoints HOME/XDG_CACHE_HOME at a per-worker
# throwaway directory (`_apply_home_env`, called from its `pytest_configure`)
# so no test ever touches the developer's real `~/.spec-kitty`. Playwright's
# Python client resolves its browser cache from `$HOME/.cache/ms-playwright`
# unless `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set explicitly — so under the isolated
# HOME it looks in an empty throwaway directory and reports "Executable
# doesn't exist", even though `playwright install chromium` cached the
# browser under the real home.
#
# The root conftest publishes the pre-isolation home via
# `SPEC_KITTY_REAL_HOME_FOR_TESTS` for exactly this kind of case
# (tests/conftest.py:63); this module's own `pytest_configure` reads it back
# and points Playwright's browser cache at it. `trylast=True` forces this
# hookimpl to run after every plain-priority `pytest_configure` (the root
# conftest's included) regardless of conftest.py registration/collection
# order, so `SPEC_KITTY_REAL_HOME_FOR_TESTS` is guaranteed populated by the
# time this reads it. All `pytest_configure` hooks (across every plugin)
# complete before collection begins, which is itself before any fixture —
# including pytest-playwright's session-scoped `browser` fixture — is ever
# instantiated, so this always wins the race against the first browser
# launch. A no-op outside this repo's isolated-home pytest setup (the real
# app's normal `spec-kitty dashboard` boot path never sets this env var).
