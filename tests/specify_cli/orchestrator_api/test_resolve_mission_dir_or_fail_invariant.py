"""PR-BOUNDARY-002 (severity 2): asserts the ``_resolve_mission_dir_or_fail``
seam invariant directly, rather than restating it as a hardcoded call-site
count in a docstring.

That docstring has been wrong twice: an original "all 8 read endpoints"
undercount, then a "17 call sites" snapshot that itself undercounted the
true 19 (its own suggested verification grep,
``grep -c '_resolve_mission_dir_or_fail(cmd' commands.py``, self-matches its
own quoted text -- the docstring's literal example string contains the
pattern it tells the reader to grep for). A number in prose drifts silently
every time a verb is added or removed; this test cannot drift the same way
because it re-derives the call-site set from the live AST on every run and
fails the moment a mission-scoped endpoint stops routing through the seam.

The invariant: every ``@app.command`` on ``orchestrator_api.commands.app``
that accepts a ``mission`` parameter -- i.e. every endpoint that reads an
EXISTING mission's directory -- calls ``_resolve_mission_dir_or_fail``
somewhere in its own body. The single documented exception is ``specify``,
which *creates* a mission rather than looking one up, so it legitimately
never resolves an existing mission dir through this seam.
