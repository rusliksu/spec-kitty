"""WP08 keystone — the NFR-006 "simple case still works" flat-topology test.

This is the **operator's binding requirement** (NFR-006 / SC-007 / SC-008 /
C-SIMPLECASE): when every diff-type target resolves to the **base** branch — a
real single-branch repo with a full 26-char ULID ``mission_id``, **no**
``coordination_branch`` declared, **no** lane worktree — spec-kitty MUST run
**exactly as it did before lanes/coordination existed**. Every adopted fragment
resolves to the base; **zero** ``.worktrees/``/coordination paths are read or
written; the write-target is ``target_branch`` (the base), not git HEAD; and the
emitted status event shape matches the pre-lane flat baseline.

Why this is the keystone (not a weaker assertion)
--------------------------------------------------
The WP05 review surfaced a binding subtlety: the NFR-006 simple case is the
**same topology** ``BookkeepingTransaction`` classifies as *legacy* (full ULID,
``meta.json`` present, no ``coordination_branch``). On that path
``MissionStatus.save`` → ``BookkeepingTransaction.acquire`` routes the
write-target through ``_resolve_legacy_lane_destination``, which reads
``git symbolic-ref HEAD`` of the operator's worktree — a seam that **BYPASSES**
the ``_identity_for_request`` write-target resolver WP05 fixed
(``coordination/status_transition.py::_resolve_write_target`` →
``resolve_placement_only(...).ref``).

Therefore this keystone drives the **full** ``MissionStatus.save`` end-to-end
path (not just the resolvers), so it observes the value spec-kitty *actually
commits*. In the genuine flat case ``git HEAD == target_branch == base`` (the
repo is on ``main``, which IS ``target_branch``), so the legacy-override reading
HEAD yields ``target_branch`` — **benign, because it equals base**. This matches
NFR-006's "byte-identical to pre-lane behaviour": the historical flat path always
committed to HEAD, and here HEAD == base. We assert the commit receipt's
``destination_ref`` resolves to ``target_branch`` (== base) via the full save
path, and that NO coord/lane surface is touched.

#1716 residual note (deferred, does NOT bite the genuine simple case)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The ``BookkeepingTransaction`` legacy-override on ``git symbolic-ref HEAD`` is a
**deferred #1716 residual** (the topology-authority root, C-003 / out of scope).
It only diverges from ``target_branch`` under **topology divergence** —
``git HEAD != target_branch`` — i.e. an operator standing on an off-target lane
branch while running a flat-topology mission (witnessed by
``tests/unit/status/test_mission_status_aggregate.py::
test_save_supports_identity_bearing_legacy_mission``, which parks HEAD on
``legacy-lane``). It does **NOT** bite the NFR-006 simple case, where HEAD == base
by construction — so NFR-006 holds. The CWD-invariant write-target fix WP05
landed lives in ``_resolve_write_target`` (asserted directly below as the
fragment-level proof), separate from the transaction's HEAD-based legacy override.
