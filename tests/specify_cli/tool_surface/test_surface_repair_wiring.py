"""Integration tests for ``init``/``upgrade`` ToolSurfaceContract wiring (T040).

These tests exercise the *real* CLI wiring (FR-001/FR-002): they invoke the
checkout-local ``specify_cli`` package as a subprocess — never a direct call to
``run_surface_repair`` — so a regression that disconnects ``init``/``upgrade``
from the repair service is caught here even though the function itself still
works in isolation.

Drift policy:
  - FR-003 missing  -> auto-created during init/upgrade (no prompt)
  - FR-004 stale    -> auto-repaired during init/upgrade (no prompt)
  - FR-006 drifted  -> ``--yes`` (non-interactive) reports only and exits
    non-zero; it MUST NOT overwrite the user's edits (NFR-007)
  - FR-008 idempotent: a second consecutive run reports zero changes
