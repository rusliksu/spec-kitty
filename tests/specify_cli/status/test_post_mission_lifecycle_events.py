"""Tests for WP01 — post-mission lifecycle events + re-open-aware classification.

Covers the FR-001/FR-002 contract:

* ``MissionReopened`` and ``FollowUpRecorded`` are registered, emittable, and
  **reducer-skipped** (WP ``status.json`` is unaffected by them).
* ``FollowUpRecorded`` is idempotent on ``(mission_id, commit_sha | pr_number)``;
  ``MissionReopened`` is append-each.
* On a merged mission (all WPs terminal), a ``MissionReopened`` event postdating
  the last merge marker makes ``derive_mission_lifecycle`` report a ``reopened``
  (actionable) surface_state — the FR-002 crux.
* The two new types are classified as post-mission lifecycle facts by the
  CLI's own ``lifecycle._POST_MISSION_EVENT_TYPES`` set (the local-only
  authority) and round-trip through ``read_events`` as reducer-skipped.
