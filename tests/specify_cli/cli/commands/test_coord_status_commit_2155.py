"""WP02 regression pins: #2154 mark_status write-leg + #2155 mixed-bundle routing.

Mission ``single-authority-resolution-gates-01KW1P0F`` / WP02 (FR-001 / FR-002).

This module pins the two defects WP02 closes, both red-first before their fix:

#2154 (T008/T009) — ``mark_status``'s WRITE leg resolved its ``tasks.md`` write
target through the kind-blind ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` (which selects
the ``-coord`` husk under coordination topology), while its COMMIT leg and
``move_task``'s validation read used the kind-aware
``resolve_planning_read_dir(kind=TASKS_INDEX)`` pointing at PRIMARY. The write
landed on coord, the validator read primary, and every WP blocked on a phantom
"unchecked subtasks" failure. The fix routes the write leg through the SAME
kind-aware authority, so all three legs CONVERGE on one dir.

  RED-FIRST (pre-T008): under coordination topology the kind-blind write dir
  (coord) ``!=`` the kind-aware validation read dir (primary) — the 3-leg
  convergence assertion FAILS. POST-T008: write leg == validation read ==
  commit-leg placement (all primary). Under FLAT topology all three already
  agree (the non-regression guard) both before and after the fix.

#2155 (T010/T011/T013) — the ``move_task`` (tasks.py) and claim (implement.py)
auto-commit bundles mixed a PRIMARY-partition WP file with coord-owned status
artifacts (``status.events.jsonl`` / ``status.json``) in ONE primary-root commit.
Under coordination topology those coord paths live UNDER ``.worktrees/``, so the
``safe_commit`` path-policy guard (#1887) refuses them — and both callers SWALLOWED
the resulting ``SafeCommitPathPolicyError`` as a soft "Auto-commit skipped" warning,
leaving the feature branch dirty. The fix partitions coord-owned status OUT of the
primary bundle (it is already on coord via the transactional emitter) and STOPS
swallowing the guard refusal. The guard itself (``git/commit_helpers.py``) is
UNCHANGED (C-006) — proven by the wrong-surface negative control below.

  RED-FIRST (pre-T010/T011): a primary bundle carrying a ``.worktrees/`` coord
  status path returns ``status="error"`` (guard refusal folded in) and leaves the
  tree dirty. POST-fix: the partitioned bundle commits cleanly; a DELIBERATELY
  wrong-surface ``.worktrees/`` write is STILL refused (guard invariant, never a
  regression).

    the two dirs differ (the kind-blind resolver returns the coord husk); under
    flat topology they are identical. A stub returning the SAME dir for both
    under coord topology would make the convergence assertion vacuous

    is no longer an attribute to patch or a call count to assert zero on, and
