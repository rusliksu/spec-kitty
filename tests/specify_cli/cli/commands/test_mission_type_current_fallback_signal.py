"""FR-005/NFR-002: loud, CLI-visible signal when ``mission current`` falls back.

``get_mission_for_feature`` (``src/specify_cli/mission.py``) silently substitutes
``software-dev`` when a feature's ``meta.json`` names a mission type that cannot be
resolved, signalling only via ``warnings.warn`` — a signal that never reaches an
operator running the CLI normally (default warning filters swallow it, and nothing
in ``current_cmd`` ever looks at it). Issue #3831 / FR-005.

These tests drive the real, pre-existing entry point end-to-end
(``spec-kitty mission-type current`` / ``current_cmd``) through
:class:`typer.testing.CliRunner`, capturing real stdout the way an operator would
see it — not ``pytest.warns`` in isolation, which only proves the warning object
exists. ``get_mission_for_feature`` itself is NOT mocked: the fallback is produced
for real, via a genuinely-unresolvable ``mission_type`` in a real ``meta.json``,
resolving against the real packaged ``software-dev`` built-in mission.

Both directions are proven (SC-004 / NFR-005 non-vacuity):
* the loud signal is PRESENT when the fallback fires (T001/T003a), and
* the loud signal is ABSENT when mission-type resolution succeeds normally,
  including the pinned legacy no-mission-field path (T003b/T004).
