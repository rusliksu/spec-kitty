"""FR-004 write-target divergence oracle (T002) + the positive mutation check.

This is the highest-value test in the net (paula S-1 / A-1, reduction-census §6):
the latent bug FR-004 fixes — the inline ``coord_branch or _current_branch``
selector at ``coordination/status_transition.py:291`` — has **ZERO** witnessing
test today, and the strongest write-path suite (``test_status_transition.py``) is
structurally blind to it because it always passes ``repo_root=repo``.

The oracle here drives ``_identity_for_request`` **without** an explicit
``repo_root`` from a CWD where ``git HEAD != target_branch`` (an off-target lane
branch), and pins the divergence:

* **inline selector**  → ``destination_ref`` = git ``HEAD`` (the off-target
  branch) — the latent bug (CWD-dependent).
* **factory resolver** (``resolve_placement_only(...).ref``) → ``target_branch``
  = ``meta.target_branch`` = ``main`` (CWD-invariant) — the correct value.

WP05 landed the adoption: ``_identity_for_request`` now routes ``destination_ref``
through ``resolve_placement_only(...).ref``, so the oracle's asserted value
flipped from the git-HEAD value to ``target_branch``. The oracle was flipped in
place, never deleted (B-4: no non-strict xfail — pinned by node-id), and now
pins read/write CONVERGENCE on the correct CWD-invariant value.
