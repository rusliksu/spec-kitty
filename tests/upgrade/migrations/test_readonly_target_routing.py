"""Regression coverage for #3651 on the 2 hard-crash migration sites.

PR #3679 introduced ``write_generated_file`` (the canonical restore→write→
strip-permission-bit writer) and routed 16 migrations through it, but left 5
sibling migrations writing bare ``Path.write_text(...)`` to the same
read-only-destined agent command/skill surfaces (``runtime/agent_commands.py``
and ``skills/installer.py`` chmod these trees ``& ~0o222``). Two of those
five have no ``try/except`` around the write at all, so a re-run against an
already-generated (and therefore read-only) target raises ``PermissionError``
and aborts the whole upgrade — #3651 verbatim:

1. ``m_3_2_0rc35_kittify_profile_handoff.py`` (``_apply_patch_to_file``) —
   writes ``.agents/skills/spec-kitty.*/SKILL.md``.
2. ``m_0_11_3_workflow_agent_flag.py`` (``_update_workflow_lines``) — writes
   ``spec-kitty.implement.md`` / ``spec-kitty.review.md`` in agent command
   dirs.

Each test below creates a read-only target file that already needs the
migration's edit, then asserts ``apply()`` does not raise ``PermissionError``
and that the edit is actually applied (not silently dropped).
