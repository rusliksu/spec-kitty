"""WP04 (FR-008) — aggregate surface-resolution negative + create-window tests.

These tests lock in the two behaviors WP04 consolidates in
``specify_cli.status.aggregate.MissionStatus``:

T016-a — **No silent first-match on an ambiguous mid8.** A bare ``mid8`` handle
that prefixes more than one mission's ``mission_id`` resolves to a *structured*
error (:class:`MissionSelectorAmbiguous`, ``error_code ==
MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR``) — never a lexically-first ``sorted(glob(...))``
pick. Mutation: re-introducing a silent-pick path that returns one of the two
candidate dirs makes ``MissionStatus.load`` return an aggregate instead of
raising, and ``test_ambiguous_mid8_handle_raises_typed_error`` fails.

T016-b — **The no-coord create→first-write window resolves PRIMARY.** A mission
whose primary checkout carries the spec dir + ``meta.json`` but declares **no**
``coordination_branch`` is in the create→first-write window: the primary checkout
is authoritative and ``MissionStatus.load`` must resolve ``read_dir`` to the
primary mission dir — NOT hard-fail. This is asserted as a cell DISTINCT from the
coord-empty hard-fail (a materialised-but-empty coord worktree → WP06's
``CoordAuthorityUnavailable``), because conflating the two would regress
first-write. Mutation: hard-failing the create-window (e.g. dropping the
``on_missing_meta`` primary fallback) makes ``load`` raise and
``test_create_window_no_coord_resolves_primary`` fails.

Fixtures are production-shaped: a real 26-char ULID (Mission Identity Model 083+),
the first 8 chars as the ``mid8`` disambiguator, and the real on-disk
``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>/`` + ``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/`` layout.
