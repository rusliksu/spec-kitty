"""Shared non-vacuity examined-floor guard (#3273) + diff-scope resolution (#3147).

``related_validator.validate_related`` and
``relative_link_fixer.check_dead_body_links`` each implement the same
"examined-count floor" shape: walk a tree, count how many things were
examined, and raise :class:`RuntimeError` when that count falls short of a
caller-supplied minimum — a scope-narrowing regression (a missing tree, an
empty tree, or a parsing change that stops matching entries) must go **red**
immediately rather than silently reporting "0 findings" over 0 examined.
``related_validator.py`` even carried a comment self-acknowledging the two
call sites were mirrors of one another. This module is the single source for
that guard so the two modules stop drifting independently.

This is a distinct contract from ``redirect_stub_generator.assert_non_vacuous``
(raises ``ValueError``) and the ``_published_pages`` census floor (also
``ValueError`` / ``CoverageError``) — those are a different exception family
and are intentionally left alone.

This module also carries :func:`resolve_changed_files`, the shared diff-scope
resolver both blocking docs gates use for their ``--changed-from`` mode
(#3147, WP02). **B-WP02 (BLOCKER, see
``kitty-specs/ci-scoping-gate-reliability-01KZP80D/investigate-squad-findings.md``):
the fail-closed trigger is git base RESOLVABILITY, never changed-set
emptiness.** ``docs-freshness.yml`` fires on many non-``.md`` paths
(``src/specify_cli/**``, ``pyproject.toml``, …), so a legitimate PR often
changes zero ``docs/**/*.md`` files; a resolved diff that yields zero
in-scope files must be a clean PASS, not an error. Only a git subprocess
failure — an unresolvable/unfetched base ref — is fail-closed. Callers MUST
NOT route the diff-scope emptiness case through :func:`assert_examined_floor`
(that floor stays reserved for the whole-tree/``push`` mode).

    ----------
    count:
        The number of items actually examined by the walk (e.g. files visited,
        edges resolved, links matched).
    minimum:
        The non-vacuity floor: the walk must examine at least this many items.

    noun:
        Description of what was counted, including any scope context (e.g.

        found under docs/"``).
