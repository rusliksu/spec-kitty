"""PII sanitizer for event envelope dicts.

Strips PII fields from event envelopes before they are written to any
git-committed file.  The function is intentionally *pure*: it accepts a
dict, returns a new dict, never mutates the input, and has no side effects.

Python 3.11+ required: parse_iso() handles the ``Z`` UTC suffix
only from 3.11 onward (PEP 680 / bpo-35829).
