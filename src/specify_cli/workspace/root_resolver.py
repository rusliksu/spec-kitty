"""Canonical-root re-exports + feature-dir canonicalization (FR-013, IC-04).

Historically this module carried its *own* worktree-pointer parser
(``_read_worktree_pointer`` / ``_canonical_from_worktree_gitdir`` /
``resolve_canonical_root``), duplicating the parser in
:mod:`specify_cli.core.paths`.  Two parsers meant two opinions about the
canonical ``primary_root`` — the Cluster C split-brain (research R-B).

WP05 (IC-04 / C-005) collapses to a **single** worktree-pointer parser in
:mod:`specify_cli.core.paths`.  ``resolve_canonical_root`` and
``WorkspaceRootNotFound`` are now re-exported from there so existing callers
keep their import sites unchanged (C-004 strangler: re-point before delete).
What remains here is :func:`canonicalize_feature_dir`, which is *not* a
worktree-pointer parser — it is a feature-dir rewrite helper that *consumes*
the single resolver.

    Single shared implementation for both write-side lock sites

    Mis-routing a status *lock* root is a concurrency defect: two processes
    anchored on the same mission via different worktrees would acquire
    different locks (no mutual exclusion). This helper routes every case
    through the single :func:`specify_cli.core.paths.resolve_canonical_root`

    Many emit callers construct ``feature_dir = repo_root / KITTY_SPECS_DIR /

    charter writes, and config writes would land inside the worktree's
    stale copy of the mission artifacts instead of the canonical repo.

    This helper rewrites such paths to point at the canonical repo's
    ``kitty-specs/<slug>`` directory. When ``feature_dir`` cannot be
    canonicalized (no enclosing git repo, unexpected layout, etc.) the
    original value is returned unchanged so callers degrade gracefully.
