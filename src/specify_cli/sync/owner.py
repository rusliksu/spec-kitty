"""Daemon owner record and ownership semantics.

This module owns the canonical on-disk record describing **which** sync daemon
process currently holds the queue/control-plane lease (PID, port, auth scope,
queue DB, executable path, package version, etc.). The foreground CLI reads
this record before mutating any sync-side state and refuses to act when it
detects an *ownership mismatch* (the running daemon was started under
different identity/version than the foreground sees today). The record also
powers orphan detection: if the recorded PID is no longer alive (or its
executable is gone), the record is stale and should be reconciled rather
than trusted.

See ``kitty-specs/mvp-sync-boundary-cli-01KRVCQS/data-model.md`` for the
schema and the D-3 mismatch contract.

Design notes
------------
- The record lives at ``<sync_root>/daemon/owner.json`` (one record per host).
- Writes are atomic: a ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, dir=…)``
  in the same directory is renamed via ``os.replace`` onto the final path,
  so concurrent readers either see the previous record or the new record —
  never a partial file. ``daemon.lock`` already serialises spawn attempts,
  so no extra lock is needed at the JSON layer (C-006).
- Token redaction is *enforced* at the health-endpoint boundary: the daemon
  must call :func:`redact_token` before serialising the record into any
  HTTP response. The dataclass itself stores the raw token; do not
  ``json.dumps(asdict(record))`` into a response without redacting first.
- Orphan detection (C-002) never sends signals to PIDs we did not spawn.
  ``is_orphan`` is a *predicate*; it never calls ``os.kill``.

    All fields are required at construction time. ``token`` is the
    daemon's control-plane bearer token and MUST be redacted before
    appearing in any health response or log line (see :func:`redact_token`).

    Fields per ``data-model.md`` D-2:

    - ``pid``: PID of the daemon process.
    - ``port``: TCP port the daemon listens on (127.0.0.1).
    - ``token``: control-plane bearer token (NEVER serialised to clients).
    - ``package_version``: ``importlib.metadata`` version of ``spec-kitty-cli``.
    - ``executable_path``: canonical (symlink-resolved) ``sys.executable`` of
      the daemon process. The invariant is established by
      :func:`_canonical_executable_path` on every write boundary (foreground
      identity, daemon record build) and on the read boundary
      (:func:`read_owner_record`). Compare sites MUST NOT re-resolve.
      Case is not normalized — case-insensitive filesystems (APFS/NTFS) may
      still produce a mismatch if daemon and foreground disagree on casing.
    - ``source_checkout_path``: repo root of the installed package (the same
      algorithm is used on the foreground side so the strings compare cleanly).
    - ``server_url``: SaaS server URL configured for this scope.
    - ``auth_principal``: authenticated user email/handle, if any.
    - ``auth_team``: authenticated team slug, if any.
    - ``auth_scope``: canonical scope string from ``build_queue_scope``.
      ``None`` here vs non-``None`` on the foreground is a mismatch (D-3).
    - ``queue_db_path``: ``default_queue_db_path()`` for this scope.

#   1. ``owner.is_orphan`` / ``list_orphan_records`` — record-based predicate
#      (recorded PID dead OR recorded executable gone). No kill.
#   2. ``orphan_sweep.enumerate_orphans`` / ``sweep_orphans`` — port-scan
#      (9400..9450, ``/api/health`` fingerprint) + HTTP-shutdown→terminate→kill
#      escalation.
#   3. ``daemon.scan_sync_daemons`` / ``cleanup_orphan_sync_daemons`` —
#      host-wide ``run_sync_daemon`` cmdline-scan + terminate→kill.
#
# FR-015 (C-005 net-subtraction) collapses these into ONE canonical reaper,
# keyed on the candidate's interpreter identity plus the daemon-root scope
# marker embedded in its cmdline at spawn. The single kill escalation lives in
# :func:`_sweep_daemon_process` below; the old surfaces now delegate their
# kill logic to it, and :func:`reap_orphan_daemons` is the single reaper wired
# into the daemon spawn hot path (``ensure_sync_daemon_running``).
#
# Scope safety (reaper-over-kill risk, #1071, FR-008): the kill gate is scoped on
# exactly TWO dimensions — a host-wide ``run_sync_daemon`` process is only reaped
# when (a) its cmdline carries the daemon-root scope marker
# (``daemon.DAEMON_SCOPE_ARG_PREFIX``, embedded at spawn) for THIS process's
# daemon state root, AND (b) its cmdline has the production spawn shape (a ``-c``
# flag whose script payload references ``run_sync_daemon``). Interpreter identity
# is deliberately NOT a third gate: under FR-008 a version/executable mismatch is
# *stale-version evidence* (an older daemon is still safe to reap when the two
# gates above match — that is the #2261 fix), never a reason to spare or kill on
# its own. The exec marker (``daemon.DAEMON_EXEC_ARG_PREFIX``) and ``Process.exe()``
# are still recorded for diagnostics/classification, but they no longer gate the
# kill — see the gate at the top of ``reap_orphan_daemons`` below. A daemon
# belonging to a different daemon root (different ``$HOME`` / container) — or one
# carrying no recognizable marker at all (spawned before the marker existed) — is
# left untouched: never kill what cannot be positively attributed to this scope.


# Per-step escalation waits (seconds). Mirror the previous ``orphan_sweep``
# budgets so existing timing characteristics are preserved.

    This is the ONE reaper (FR-015) wired into the ``ensure_sync_daemon_running``
    spawn hot path so every spawn reaps stale orphans belonging to THIS daemon
    scope first (FR-014b / #1071).

    Discovery reuses the host-wide cmdline-scan (``scan_sync_daemons``); the
    recorded-singleton PID is already excluded by it.

    **Kill authority — daemon-root scope marker is primary (FR-008).**
    A candidate is in scope when BOTH of the following hold:

    * its cmdline carries the daemon-root scope marker naming THIS process's
      resolved daemon state root, AND
    * its cmdline has the production spawn shape (``-c`` flag referencing
      ``run_sync_daemon``).

    evidence only and is NOT a kill gate (FR-008)**.  Same-scope daemons from
    a prior installed version therefore flip from skipped → reaped — this is
    the direct fix for the 18-orphan accumulation reported in #2261.

    Conservative protections preserved (T009):
    * Pre-marker daemons (no scope arg) → ``operator_required/pre_marker``:
      not reaped; surfaced by ``sync status`` / ``sync doctor``.
    * Cross-root daemons (marker ≠ this root) → ``operator_required/cross_root``:
      not reaped; requires ``auth doctor --reset --force`` (WP05).
    * The recorded singleton is never in ``orphan_processes`` (already excluded
      by ``scan_sync_daemons``), so it is never a kill candidate.
    * ``owner.json`` (``read_owner_record``) is never consulted for kill
      decisions (FR-003); ``skipped_details`` carries classification records
      for observability only.

    ``executable_scope`` is accepted for backward compatibility but is no longer
    used in the kill decision (FR-008); it is carried in ``ForegroundScope``
    for diagnostic / skip-details enrichment only.

    With ``dry_run=True`` no signals are sent; in-scope candidates still appear
