# CONTRACT VERIFICATION
# Verified 2026-04-21: The spec-kitty-saas repo is not co-located with this
# codebase; the cli-saas-current-api.yaml contract file is not accessible.
#
# Verification performed against the *local* SaaS sync client:
#   src/specify_cli/sync/client.py -> async def send_event(self, event: dict)
#   src/specify_cli/sync/emitter.py -> _route_event() (lines 981-1016)
#
# Client protocol: send_event(event: dict) is ASYNC and takes a single flat
# dict with an "event_type" discriminator field at the top level.  There is NO
# idempotency_key keyword argument.  The emitter pattern (emitter.py:993-1000)
# calls it via asyncio.ensure_future() when a loop is running, or via
# loop.run_until_complete() otherwise.
#
# Envelope shape (mission do-dispatch-open-op-lifecycle, decision
# 01KTSJEQANMNEV16WMSAJP6FR1 — no wire-compat with the pre-mission envelope;
# SaaS handlers are unimplemented, #1720/#1693):
#   Envelope dicts are rebuilt 1:1 from the v2 Op event models
#   (contracts/op-record-events.md):
#   ProfileInvocationStarted:   event_type + all OpStartedEvent fields
#                               (None fields omitted; request_text policy-gated)
#   ProfileInvocationCompleted: event_type + all OpCompletedEvent fields incl.
#                               closed_by (evidence_ref omitted when None and
#                               policy-gated)

    Never raises — the seam guarantees safe-degrade on missing registration.

    **In production this returns ``None`` every time, and has always done so**
    (#3030 FR-032). No package registers a SaaS-client factory. ``sync`` used to
    register one, but its whole body read ``token_manager._ws_client`` — an attribute
    ``src/`` has never assigned — so it answered ``None`` on every call; the
    registration was deleted rather than left as an accident that happens to be safe.
    Everything below this lookup in :func:`_propagate_one` is therefore inert until
    someone registers a real factory, and that is a deliberate state, not an oversight.

    Two things follow, and neither is optional:

    * The consent gate in :func:`_propagate_one` runs **before** this lookup and stays
      there. It is what makes registering a transport a safe act rather than an
      egress incident, so it must not be removed on the ground that the send is
      currently inert.
    * Registering a factory here opens an egress path carrying ``request_text`` — the
      verbatim agent prompt. Wiring it to ``SyncRuntime.ws_client`` was considered
      during #3030 and explicitly rejected.

    coercions this replaced, both of which resolved an *unintelligible* value to the
    most permissive rule available — an unknown ``event`` became ``STARTED`` and a
    malformed ``mode_of_work`` became ``None``, and both land on a rule with
    ``project=True, include_request_text=True``. Same shape as FR-025's guard: a
    value meaning "unknown" was spelled the same way as a definite answer, and the
    definite answer it borrowed was the permissive one. Reachable only through a
    schema change (the models validate both fields against Literals today), which

    **Absence is not malformation, and the two must not re-collapse.**
    ``OpCompletedEvent`` carries no ``mode_of_work`` at all, and neither do pre-v2
    records; those keep the documented legacy default (``None`` → treated as
    ``TASK_EXECUTION`` by ``resolve_projection``). Refusing on absence instead would
