"""Freshness computation for charter / synced bundle / synthesized DRG.

Detection rules (per ``contracts/charter-status-json.md``, re-pointed at
``charter.yaml`` by ``consolidate-charter-bundle`` WP06 / data-model.md
Landmine 2):

* ``charter_source.state`` reports whether the resolving charter source —
  ``.kittify/charter/charter.yaml`` — exists and parses: ``missing`` when
  absent, ``invalid`` when present but unparseable, ``fresh`` otherwise.
  Post-inversion ``charter.yaml`` (not ``charter.md``) is the authoritative,
  resolving source; ``charter.md`` is a curated, never-resolving prose
  companion (data-model.md Entity: ``charter.md``) and is not consulted
  here. The historical ``charter.md``-SHA-vs-``metadata.yaml::charter_hash``
  staleness mechanism is **retired outright, not re-homed** — a hash of
  ``charter.yaml`` cannot live *inside* ``charter.yaml`` (chicken-egg), so
  there is no meaningful upstream artifact left to compare against at this
  layer. ``charter_source`` therefore never returns ``stale``.
* ``synced_bundle.state = "missing"`` when ``charter.yaml`` (the sole entry
  in ``_BUNDLE_FILES`` / ``charter.bundle.BUNDLE_CONTENT_HASH_FILES``,
  contracts/manifest-v2.md M1/M3) is absent; ``"stale"`` when it exists but
  ``charter_source`` is not ``fresh`` (i.e. ``invalid``); ``"fresh"``
  otherwise.
* ``synthesized_drg.state = "stale"`` when the synthesis manifest's
  ``bundle_content_hash`` does not match a freshly recomputed content-identity
  hash of the current ``charter.yaml`` (``charter.bundle.
  compute_bundle_content_hash``) — a content comparison, not a timestamp
  comparison. A missing/``None`` stored hash is treated the same as a
  mismatch: ``stale``. Two distinct ``None`` causes with different
  recoveries: a *legacy-manifest* ``None`` (the field predates this fix)
  self-heals to ``fresh`` on the next ``spec-kitty charter synthesize`` /
  ``resynthesize`` run, which stamps the current hash; a *missing-file*
  ``None`` (``compute_bundle_content_hash`` returns ``None`` when
  ``charter.yaml`` itself is absent) does NOT self-heal via ``synthesize``
  alone until the file exists. This comparison only runs once
  ``synced_bundle.state == "fresh"`` (see the precedence rule below).

  **Spurious authoring-staleness (data-model.md Landmine 2 extension,
  alphonso MINOR-3 — DECIDED, option (b), see
  ``traces/decisions.md``)**: because the authored surface and the
  content-hash input are now the SAME file, an authoring-only edit to
  ``governance``/``directives``/``activation`` (which does not change the
  derived ``catalog``) also changes the whole-file hash and therefore trips
  this comparison to ``stale`` — even though nothing *derived* drifted.
  This is accepted as expected behaviour, not a defect: it is always
  healable by the very next ``spec-kitty charter synthesize`` /
  ``resynthesize`` (which recomputes the hash from current content and
  re-stamps the manifest), so it is a transient, self-clearing state, never
  a permanent-stale dead-end (unlike the retired #2758 missing-file trap).
* ``synthesized_drg.state = "missing"`` when ``.kittify/doctrine/graph.yaml``
  is absent AND the manifest does not declare ``built_in_only: true``.
* ``synthesized_drg.state = "built_in_only"`` when the manifest declares
  ``built_in_only: true`` (FR-009). When a project ``graph.yaml`` is ALSO
  present the manifest disowns it — it is *stale graph residue* (FR-006 /
  C2-f), not a contradiction: the reader still reports the authoritative
  ``built_in_only`` state and attaches a non-blocking residue diagnostic in
  ``detail`` (the formerly-terminal ``invalid`` state is unreachable for this
  condition, so preflight is no longer blocked).
* ``synthesized_drg`` never returns ``invalid`` — the only ``invalid`` producer
  is ``_compute_charter_source`` ("charter.yaml exists but cannot be
  parsed"), a genuine inconsistency that legitimately blocks preflight.

Retired in this pass (#2759, data-model.md / contracts/manifest-v2.md):
the config<->references/graph activation-parity read
(``_activation_parity_drift_reason``) that used to run as a second signal
composed with the content-hash comparison above. It is moot once freshness
reads ``charter.yaml`` directly — activation now lives INSIDE the same file
the content hash already covers, so a config<->references/graph divergence
of the pre-relocation kind cannot exist anymore. (The #2758
``first_missing_bundle_file`` helper is a separate, still-live concern owned
by ``charter.bundle`` / ``specify_cli.cli.commands.charter._synthesis`` —
not this module.)

All sub-objects are always present in the result; ``state="missing"`` is the
default when a file is absent.

LD-3 routing (FR-013 / WP07): the synthesis manifest is loaded through the
``charter.synthesizer.manifest`` public read API (``load_yaml`` + the canonical
``MANIFEST_PATH`` constant); the doctrine graph path is anchored to
``charter.bundle.DOCTRINE_DIR``. This consumes the chokepoint module's
read-only surface without invoking ``ensure_charter_bundle_fresh``'s
refresh/write semantics — ``compute_freshness`` is a pure observer and must
never trigger a sync (NFR-001 perf, and would otherwise defeat the freshness
report it produces).
