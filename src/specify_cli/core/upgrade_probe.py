"""PyPI upgrade probe with no-upgrade classification.

This module is the network-touching half of the "no-upgrade available" UX
introduced for FR-007 / WP09. It performs a single, timeout-bounded GET against
PyPI's JSON metadata endpoint and classifies the installed CLI version.

The probe applies the **secure-design-checklist** tactic
(`packs/built-in/tactics/secure-design-checklist.tactic.yaml`) to the new
external surface. Specifically:

- **Least Privilege**: a single GET against a public endpoint, no auth, no PII.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: every exception is caught and resolves to
  ``UpgradeChannel.UNKNOWN`` with the error captured. No exception escapes
  into the CLI hot path.
- **Complete Mediation**: the timeout is enforced via ``httpx.Client(timeout=...)``
  and applied to the request.
- **Economy of Mechanism**: pure functions, frozen dataclasses, no I/O outside
  the GET. The cache is a sibling module's concern.

The probe **never** raises. Callers can rely on the returned
``UpgradeProbeResult`` being well-formed even on total network failure.
