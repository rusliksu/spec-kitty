# Tasks Directory

This directory contains work package (WP) prompt files.

All WP files are stored flat in `tasks/`. Status is tracked in `status.events.jsonl`, not in WP frontmatter.

## Work Package File Format

Each WP file **MUST** use YAML frontmatter:

## Status Tracking

Status is tracked via the canonical event log (`status.events.jsonl`), not in WP frontmatter.
Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task` to change WP status:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <lane>
```

Example:
```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to doing

    This is a slim, typer-free version of the ``_commit_to_branch`` helper
    in the CLI module. It delegates straight to ``safe_commit`` with no
    try/except of its own, so it raises on BOTH a hard git failure and an
    empty changeset (``safe_commit`` itself raises ``RuntimeError`` when
    there is nothing to commit -- it does NOT silently no-op). Callers that
    know their changeset is always non-empty (e.g. the FR-001 create-scaffold
    commit call site, where the files genuinely differ from HEAD at create
    time) can safely treat any raise here as a hard failure.

    ``tasks/.gitkeep``) lands in a SINGLE commit rather than committing

    resolved ``target_branch`` differs from the checkout, the metadata commit
    silently landed on whatever branch the operator happened to be parked on
    instead of the mission's actual primary home. ``SPEC`` is a
    ``_PRIMARY_ARTIFACT_KINDS`` member (same as ``PRIMARY_METADATA``, the kind
    the committed ``meta.json`` file itself belongs to): both resolve to the

    """Create a new feature with all scaffolding.

    This is the programmatic API for feature creation.  Unlike the CLI
    command, it returns a structured result and raises domain exceptions
    instead of calling ``typer.Exit()``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo_root:
        Absolute path to the project root (must contain ``.kittify/`` and
        ``kitty-specs/``).  When *None*, ``locate_project_root()`` is called
        automatically.
    mission_slug:
        Bare slug such as ``"user-auth"`` or ``"068-feature"`` (kebab-case).
    mission:
        Optional mission key (e.g. ``"documentation"``, ``"software-dev"``).
        Defaults to ``"software-dev"`` when not provided.
    target_branch:
        Explicit target branch for the feature.  When *None* the current
        git branch is used.
    friendly_name:
        Optional mission title shown on operator-facing surfaces. When omitted,
        it is derived from ``mission_slug``.
    purpose_tldr:
        Optional one-line product/CXO summary for the mission. When omitted,
        it defaults to the resolved ``friendly_name``.
    purpose_context:
        Optional short paragraph explaining the mission in stakeholder terms.
        When omitted, it defaults to a branch-aware summary sentence.
    pr_bound:
        Persist the confirmed pull-request binding in the initial metadata
        write and commit. Defaults to ``False``.
    topology:
        Operator's create-time mission shape (#2218). Defaults to
        :attr:`MissionTopology.COORD` for backward-compat. The coordination
        branch is minted only for the coordination-bearing shapes
        (``COORD`` / ``LANES_WITH_COORD``); ``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES`` skip
        the mint and never write ``coordination_branch``. The explicit choice
        is persisted verbatim into ``meta.json`` — never re-derived from
        ``classify_topology`` (which cannot reproduce ``LANES`` pre-finalize).
    allow_worktree_context:
        Bypass the worktree-context guard (step 2) that otherwise raises when
        the *process* ``cwd`` resolves inside a git worktree. Defaults to
        ``False``, preserving the interactive/CLI guard that protects
        operators from accidentally scaffolding a mission inside a lane
        worktree instead of the project root checkout. Intended for
        programmatic callers — notably ``tests/_factories.make_mission()``
        (FR-008) — that pass an explicit ``repo_root`` pointing at an
        isolated (often temporary) repository while the test process itself
        happens to be running from within a lane worktree checkout, which is
        this project's normal execution context for its own test suite.
    owned_checkout:
        Explicit checkout root owned by this invocation. The path is validated
        against the independently resolved primary checkout before the existing
        worktree-context guard can be bypassed. ``None`` preserves the existing
        guard and write-root behavior exactly.
    retain_branches:
        Create-time retention opt-in (#3131 FR-009). When ``True``, mints
        ``retain_branches: true`` into ``meta.json`` so downstream ``spec-kitty
        merge`` cleanup honors the policy from creation. Defaults to
        ``False``, in which case the field is left ABSENT from ``meta.json``
        (never written as ``false``) so non-retaining missions stay
        byte-identical to pre-#3131 output (FR-010, SC-004).
    retain_worktrees:
        Create-time retention opt-in (#3131 FR-009) for worktrees, mirroring
        ``retain_branches``. Defaults to ``False`` (field left ABSENT).

    Returns
    -------
    MissionCreationResult
        Structured result with all paths and metadata.

    Raises
    ------
    MissionCreationError
        On any validation or creation failure.
    charter.activation.pack_context.CharterPackConfigError
        When the project has no activated mission types (an absent or empty
        ``mission_type_activations`` set). This is the WP04 fail-closed at the
        mission-create / mission-type-use boundary: ``PackContext``
        construction is total, so the "provision your charter" error is
        raised here rather than at construction time.
    specify_cli.runtime.resolver.TemplateConfigurationError
        If the activated mission type cannot resolve its configured ``spec``
        template. Resolution happens before any mission state is created.
