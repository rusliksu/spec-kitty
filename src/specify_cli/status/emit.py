"""Status emit orchestration pipeline.

Single entry point for ALL state changes in the canonical status model.
Validates a transition, appends an event to the JSONL log, materializes
a status snapshot, and emits SaaS telemetry.

The event log is the sole authority for mutable WP state. In explicit
phase-1 compatibility mode (``meta.json`` with ``status_phase: 1``),
this pipeline may mirror the canonical lane into an existing WP
frontmatter ``lane`` field. That mirror is transitional and never
authoritative.

**Verdict durability (WP03 / FR-008 / contracts/verdict-durability-write.md,
mission verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35):** for a recorded verdict
(any outbound-from-``in_review`` transition, which the FSM requires to carry
a ``ReviewResult``), the ``store.append_event_stream_atomic_verified`` call
in step 5 below IS the single authoritative durable act (contract G1/NFR-004)
-- the same append every other transition already goes through, not a
bespoke second write. It never holds ``feature_status_lock`` across a
``git`` subprocess (NFR-001/G3: the only subprocess call on this path,
resolving the lock's own path, happens BEFORE the lock is acquired -- see
``locking.feature_status_lock``), and the event log itself is
union-merge-driver protected (``.gitattributes`` -> ``merge=spec-kitty-
event-log``) so two concurrent distinct verdicts union rather than clobber
(SC-003). The separate ``review-cycle-N.md`` artifact commit
(``review/cycle.py::_commit_review_cycle_artifact``) is NOT part of this
authoritative act -- it stays a hard-error, best-effort-in-name-only render
until WP05's reader flip demotes it (D-PLAN-11).

Pipeline order (critical -- do not reorder):
    1. resolve_lane_alias(to_lane)
    2. Derive from_lane from last event for this WP (or "genesis" for unseeded WPs)
    3. validate_transition(from_lane, resolved_lane, ...)
    4. Create StatusEvent with ULID event_id
    5. store.append_event(feature_dir, event)
    6. reducer.materialize(feature_dir)
    7. _saas_fan_out(event, mission_slug, repo_root)
    8. Return the event

    This is the public emit API downstream WPs call to record runtime-state

    review overrides) without traversing the FSM.

    Pipeline:
        1. Resolve the write target via ``canonicalize_feature_dir(feature_dir)``
           — never ``Path.cwd()`` (FR-012 / C-003 / #2647).
        2. Mint a real ULID and build the typed event via the sanctioned
           ``wp_state.annotate()`` non-transition seam (which refuses an empty
           delta and validates ``wp_id``).
        3. Persist through the durability-verified store append seam under the
           per-feature status lock, then best-effort materialize the snapshot.

    Args:
        feature_dir: kitty-specs feature directory (canonicalized here).
        wp_id: Target work-package id (e.g. ``"WP01"``).
        delta: Typed partial runtime-state payload. An empty delta is refused.
        actor: Identity of the actor causing the change.
        mission_slug: Mission identifier — used only as the status-lock key.
        at: Optional ISO-8601 occurrence timestamp; defaults to now.
        repo_root: Optional repo root for status-lock resolution.

    Returns:
        The persisted :class:`InnerStateChanged`.

    Raises:
