    Carries forward ``force_count`` **and** every untouched runtime slot from
    ``previous`` (per-field independence, FR-002) so a later transition never
    silently erases ``shell_pid``/``subtasks``/``notes``/``tracker_refs``/…
    (the reducer replace-dict hazard).

    The ``planned -> claimed`` transition is the only transition that writes a
    runtime slot: it extracts ``shell_pid``/``shell_pid_created_at``/``agent``
    from its ``policy_metadata`` sidecar into the snapshot slots (FR-004 claim
    path). ``policy_metadata`` may be ``None`` — read defensively.

    **``review_result`` (FR-001/T025-T026, WP07)** is a second, analogous
    exception, but its trigger is WIDER than "outbound from ``in_review``"
    alone. The FSM guard (``wp_state.InReviewState.guard_for`` ->
    ``_check_review_result``) requires a ``ReviewResult`` only on a
    non-forced outbound-from-``in_review`` edge — but the EMIT path applies no
    ``from_lane`` filter of its own: ``status/emit.py``,
    ``coordination/status_transition.py``, and
    ``orchestrator_api/commands.py``'s external ``transition`` command all
    thread an operator/caller-supplied ``review_result`` onto the event
    verbatim, regardless of ``from_lane``. ``in_progress -> approved`` is a
    legal edge (``InProgressState.allowed_targets``) gated on evidence, not on
    ``from_lane`` — so a single-hop transition carrying both ``evidence`` and
    a populated ``ReviewResult`` is constructible and persistable without ever
    passing through ``in_review``. A trigger keyed SOLELY on
    ``from_lane == IN_REVIEW`` would silently drop that verdict (and, on a
    later unrelated transition, resurrect whatever stale value a prior
    ``in_review`` cycle had carried-forward) — exactly the multi-authority bug
    this mission exists to close. The rule is therefore: **any event carrying
    a populated ``ReviewResult`` populates the slot with it, full stop**; the
    ``from_lane == IN_REVIEW`` leg exists ADDITIONALLY to capture the
    forced-null case the guard bypass creates (a forced exit from
    ``in_review`` supplying no ``ReviewResult`` still must land an explicit
    ``None``, T028 — an event with no ``review_result`` and ``from_lane !=
    IN_REVIEW`` has no such guarantee to make, so it only carries forward).
    Deliberately NOT a ``_RUNTIME_SLOTS`` row (plan.md IC-04's risk note;
    widening that tuple would red ``test_2093_authority_invariant.py``'s arm
    2). The slot being written to ``None`` (T028) is distinct from the slot
    being entirely ABSENT for a WP that has never carried a verdict or exited
    ``in_review`` (T027's un-migrated/never-reviewed compatibility case). See
    :func:`review_result_from_state` / :func:`event_sourced_review_result` for
    the reader that preserves this three-way distinction, and

      binding actuals ``role`` / ``agent_profile`` / ``agent_profile_version`` /

      value replaces the same-named slot; the most-recent annotation's actual
      wins across the lifecycle (INV-8).
    - ``subtasks``: **per-subtask replace** (merge by subtask id).
    - ``note``: **append** to the ``notes`` list (field/slot name mismatch:
      delta ``note`` -> snapshot ``notes``, so it is NOT a replace slot).

      ``tracker_refs_replace`` (present) **wholesale-replaces** the slot
      (dedup-preserving order) and takes precedence when both are present — the
      replace channel is what lets a ``--replace`` drop stale refs rather than
      resurrect them.
    - ``review``: **replace** with ``ReviewOverride.to_dict()``, UNLESS the
      delta is the all-empty **release sentinel** (:attr:`ReviewOverride.
      is_release_sentinel` — every field empty, the shape ``--to planned``
      rollback emits, see ``_mt_emit_runtime_state``), in which case the slot
      is a deliberate **clear** instead: it drops back to ``None`` rather than
      persisting an empty dict, so a stale "superseded by approval" record
      left by an earlier review-artifact override does not survive onto a WP
      that has since rolled back to ``planned`` with a fresh rejection. A
      *partially*-filled override (some but not all fields present, e.g. a
      blank ``reason`` — #2684 WP09) is a DIFFERENT case from the release
      sentinel: it is still persisted (so its presence remains visible), just
      not :attr:`ReviewOverride.complete` — the merge gate still blocks on it.

    **Precedence vs. ``review_result`` (T026, WP07)**: ``review`` (this slot,
    written here) and ``review_result`` (written in :func:`_wp_state_from_event`
    on an outbound-from-``in_review`` transition) are two DIFFERENT facts and
    are never collapsed into one — ``review`` is the arbiter's override
    decision, ``review_result`` is the reviewer's own verdict. Both may be
    populated simultaneously for the same WP (an override recorded after a
    standing rejection, for instance). **Precedence rule**: an arbiter
    override in ``review`` (when :meth:`ReviewOverride.complete` is true)
    clears the merge gate over a ``review_result`` of ``"changes_requested"``
    for gate-clearing purposes ONLY — this matches the pre-existing arbiter
    behaviour (an override already clears the gate without a fresh approval,
    ``test_2684_review_override_recognition.py``). It does **not** overwrite
    or erase the ``review_result`` slot's own value: a consumer asking "what
    did the reviewer actually say" (as opposed to "is the gate clear") still
    reads the real, un-mutated ``review_result``. Gate-clearing precedence is
    applied by each consumer (e.g. ``post_merge/review_artifact_consistency.
    py``'s event-sourced check), never by overwriting either slot here.

    ``ReviewResult | None``:

    - ``slot_present=False`` (``result=None``): the reduced snapshot carries no
      ``review_result`` key for this WP at all — no reduced entry exists, or
      the WP has never undergone an outbound-from-``in_review`` transition
      (the only transition class :func:`_wp_state_from_event` writes this slot
      on). This is the un-migrated / never-reviewed compatibility case.
      **Post-WP05 (verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35, FR-002/FR-003):**
      the frontmatter-parsing fallback this paragraph used to describe
      (``rejected_review_artifact_for_terminal_lane`` /
      ``latest_review_artifact_verdict``) is RETIRED — those two functions no
      longer exist. Every caller now treats ``slot_present=False`` as "no
      verdict recorded" directly (G2, contracts/verdict-authority-read.md):
      a safety-gate consumer reads this as "no approval"/"no block", never a
      frontmatter resurrection.
    - ``slot_present=True, result=None``: the event log HAS spoken for this
      WP's most recent outbound-from-``in_review`` transition, and its
      authoritative answer is "no verdict was ever recorded" — typically a
      ``--force`` transition that supplied no ``ReviewResult`` (T028), or a
      damaged/malformed slot value (:func:`review_result_from_state`'s own
      fail-closed catch). Both shapes collapse to this SAME tuple — see
      ``post_merge/review_artifact_consistency.py``'s
      ``_event_sourced_gate_verdict`` for one call-site's treatment.
    - ``slot_present=True, result=<ReviewResult>``: the event log's own
      recorded verdict — authoritative per FR-001, regardless of what any
      review-cycle artifact's frontmatter says.
