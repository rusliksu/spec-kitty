"""The Sync Dispatcher — select -> post -> record over one active target (WP07).

This module is the seam where the mission's central behavioural shift becomes
observable: **a successful upload stops deleting the local event and instead
becomes a ledger update** (FR-001). It is the non-destructive replacement for the
old ``SyncQueue.process_batch_results`` success/duplicate/failed_permanent path,
which DELETED the local row — here those three outcomes become ledger writes and
the journal payload is **never** deleted (contract §3).

Three phases, each a small helper so the public :func:`dispatch` stays a thin
orchestrator (T044, complexity ceiling 15; ruff ``C901`` / Sonar ``S3776``):

1. **Select** (:func:`_select_undelivered`) — read the journal's event universe and
   delegate to the WP05 ledger's universe-aware ``select_undelivered`` query, which
   returns events with **no terminal-success and no terminal-failed** row for the
   active target (FR-004 / FR-015). No SQL lives here; no ``queue.py`` import.
2. **Post** (:func:`_post`) — hand the selected events to the active target's
   :class:`~specify_cli.delivery.receivers.DeliveryReceiver` (WP06). One dispatch
   path drives Teamspace / external / stub equivalently — there is **no** target-type
   conditional in this module (contract §4).
3. **Record** (:func:`_record`) — map each :class:`DeliveryResult` to a WP05 ledger
   write. ``success``/``duplicate`` -> terminal-success; ``pending``/``rejected``/
   ``transient`` -> their aligned ledger states; ``terminal_failed`` -> the WP05
   terminal-failed writer (parked, retained, excluded from future selection, FR-015).
   This phase never deletes a journal event — the journal is read-only here (FR-001).

**D-020 coalescing carry (FR-011).** The journal's coalescing seam defaults to a
no-op; the dispatcher is the live integration point that activates WP08's real
strategy via :func:`event_journal.coalesce.install`. Without this call, FR-011
coalescing is dead in production. WP08's ``coalesce`` module is a sibling dependency
that lands alongside this WP at merge; until it is present the install degrades
safely (the journal keeps its no-op seam) so a drain never breaks.

Per **C-001** this module imports nothing from ``sync/queue.py`` or
``specify_cli.events``; it consumes only the WP03 journal, WP05 ledger, and WP06
receiver public surfaces.

    select -> post -> record. A successful drain leaves the journal row count
    unchanged and writes terminal-success ledger rows (FR-001).

    *exclude* is an optional in-memory skip set (event IDs) applied to this

    no progress earlier in the same pass, so a permanent content rejection cannot
