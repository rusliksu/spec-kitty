"""Rewrite legacy ``opposed_by`` entries in a downstream/org-pack into DRG edges.

FR-015 (contract: ``kitty-specs/doctrine-tension-edges-01KY1WPC/contracts/
migrate-opposed-by.md``). This module is the escape hatch for downstream /
org-pack doctrine content that still authors the legacy ``opposed_by``
(``Contradiction``) field once ``opposed_by`` is dropped from
``additionalProperties: false`` on the ``directive``/``tactic``/``paradigm``
schemas (mission ``doctrine-tension-edges-01KY1WPC`` WP03). Without this tool
an org pack that still authors ``opposed_by`` would only see a schema
validation error pointing at the symptom, not the fix.

This module is fully additive: it operates on an *external* pack directory
the operator points it at (``--pack PATH``) and never touches this repo's
own built-in doctrine content (that migration is WP02/WP03's job, landing on
different files). It only needs the relation vocabulary WP01 already
introduced (``Relation.IN_TENSION_WITH`` / ``RECONCILES_TENSION`` /
``REJECTS`` and ``NodeKind.ANTI_PATTERN``) to exist.

Classification heuristic
-------------------------
Each ``opposed_by`` entry is a mapping ``{type, id, reason}`` naming another
artifact the source directive/tactic/paradigm "opposes". Per D1/D2
(research.md) there is no purely mechanical signal in the *prose* that
distinguishes a tension-style entry from an anti-pattern-rejection-style
entry in general -- classifying by keyword-sniffing the ``reason`` text
would be a guess dressed up as precision. Instead this module asks a single,
structural, mechanically-checkable question:

    Does an artifact file of the declared ``type`` and ``id`` actually
    exist elsewhere in the pack?

- **Yes** -- the target is a first-class artifact of equal standing: a
  genuine peer rule that competes with the source on the same decision,
  never itself a "wrong" idea to be rejected. This is exactly the shape of
  a *tension* (D1): both sides remain valid; neither supersedes the other.
  The entry is rewritten to a symmetric ``in_tension_with`` edge,
  canonicalized with the lexicographically-smaller URN as ``source`` (C-002,
  mirroring WP02) so a tension pair only ever has one canonical direction.

- **No** -- the target has no artifact of its own anywhere in the pack. By
  construction it cannot be a competing rule; there is no rule there to
  compete with. It is a *label for a bad practice*, referenced only in
  order to be rejected. The entry is rewritten to a directional ``rejects``
  edge from the source artifact to a new (or reused) ``anti_pattern:<id>``
  node (creating the node, marked ``kind: anti_pattern``, the first time it
  is targeted -- mirrors WP02's node shape).

This heuristic was validated against every ``opposed_by`` entry in this
repo's own built-in doctrine content (the reference corpus WP03 is about to
retire): the two tension-style entries (``DIRECTIVE_024`` <-> ``DIRECTIVE_025``,
and the tactic <-> ``DIRECTIVE_025`` pair) both resolve to real artifact
files; all eight anti-pattern-rejection entries (e.g. ``brownfield-onboarding``
-> ``big-ball-of-mud``) resolve to none.

**Unclassifiable entries (T036)**: if the declared ``type``/``id`` pair does
NOT resolve to a file under the declared type, but the *same* ``id`` DOES
exist under a *different* artifact type elsewhere in the pack, the
structural signal is self-contradictory -- is this a mistyped peer
reference, or a coincidentally-named anti-pattern? This module refuses to
guess: it records the entry as unclassifiable, naming the source file, the
entry, and the conflicting match, rather than silently picking a relation.
The same happens for a structurally malformed entry (missing/unknown
``type``, missing/empty ``id``). Callers (the CLI layer) surface these as a
clear, actionable diagnostic and a non-zero exit -- never a raw Pydantic
validation traceback.

Precedent / conventions reused
-------------------------------
Modelled on :mod:`specify_cli.migration.backfill_identity`'s
scan-and-report shape (a pure function returns a structured result; the CLI
layer formats it) and reuses the core DRG models from
:mod:`doctrine.drg.models` (``DRGGraph``, ``DRGNode``, ``DRGEdge``,
``NodeKind``, ``Relation``) rather than inventing a parallel schema. New
edges/nodes are written into per-kind ``<kind>.graph.yaml`` fragment files
at the pack root (``directive.graph.yaml`` / ``tactic.graph.yaml`` /
``paradigm.graph.yaml``), mirroring both WP02's authoring surface (the
built-in doctrine tree's own ``packs/built-in/<kind>.graph.yaml`` fragments)
and this repo's existing convention that an edge is filed under the graph
fragment matching its (possibly canonicalized) ``source`` URN's kind -- e.g.
``paradigm.graph.yaml`` already carries ``paradigm -> directive`` ``requires``
edges today.

All functions are safe to call repeatedly: once every ``opposed_by`` entry
has been rewritten and removed, a subsequent run finds nothing left to scan
and performs no writes (idempotent, NFR "safe to run against an
already-clean pack").
