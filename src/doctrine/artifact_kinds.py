"""Canonical enumeration of all doctrine artifact kinds.

Zero-dependency: no imports from specify_cli or other doctrine subpackages.

Canonical charter kind universe (R-009)
---------------------------------------
The charter command surfaces (``activate`` / ``deactivate`` / ``list`` /
``context --include``) operate over the *charter kind universe*, which is::

    the 9 activatable ``ArtifactKind`` kinds  +  ``mission-type``

``mission-type`` is **not** an :class:`ArtifactKind` member — it is a mission-tier
concept handled separately (see FR-032 / WP04). Callers route a mission-type
token explicitly; :meth:`ArtifactKind.from_operator_token` raises the distinct,
documented :class:`MissionTypeNotAnArtifactKind` for it rather than silently
mapping it to an artifact kind (R-009 / CL-1: no silent fallback).

``template`` *is* an :class:`ArtifactKind` member but is resolved specially
(mission-tier, empty glob — see :attr:`ArtifactKind.glob_pattern`); it is not one
of the 9 non-template artifact tokens enumerated in :data:`CHARTER_KIND_TOKENS`.

``anti_pattern`` *is* an :class:`ArtifactKind` member (mission
``doctrine-tension-edges-01KY1WPC``, D2) but is also excluded from the charter
kind universe via :data:`_NON_AUGMENTATION_ELIGIBLE_KINDS`: an anti-pattern
node is never activated as a live rule and is never hand-authored as a
standalone artifact file, so it is not one of the 9 charter-activatable
artifact tokens either.

Consumers must route every operator kind string through
:meth:`ArtifactKind.from_operator_token` (CC-4) — no second kind enumeration
may be re-declared elsewhere.
