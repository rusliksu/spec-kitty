"""``DoctrineService`` builders (WP06 T031, #2532) — the US1-frozen region.

Relocated verbatim from ``charter.context``: :func:`_build_doctrine_service`
and :func:`_build_activation_aware_doctrine_service` — the **LAST** cluster of
the ``context.py`` decomposition (research.md Decision 7/8, extraction step
13). This is the region US1 (#3064 / mission
``charter-delivery-finish-context-degod``'s empty-charter workstream) touched
via ``_build_activation_aware_doctrine_service``'s "always wrap" contract
(R5); it was extracted here byte-identical against the then-frozen US1 code.

FR-008 unification (charter-sole-door-bypass-closure-01KZ3WAA WP01): this
module now also exposes the single canonical
:func:`build_activation_aware_doctrine_service` — the ONE public entry point
that replaces ``specify_cli.doctrine_service_factory.build_activation_aware_doctrine_service``
(the latter becomes a thin re-export of this one, C-001). It is itself a
thin delegate to :func:`_build_activation_aware_doctrine_service` — the
SINGLE body in this module that constructs
:class:`~charter.resolver.DoctrineService` (cycle-2 review fix, Blocker 2:
the public function previously duplicated that body's construction logic
for the ``org_roots=None`` case, re-creating inside one module the exact
C-001 divergence risk the WP exists to close). It also collapses the "build
raw, conditionally wrap" pattern previously duplicated inline at
``specify_cli/charter_runtime/lint/checks/org_layer.py`` (both provenance-
scan sites now route the raw inner construction through
:func:`_build_doctrine_service` below — the one place in this codebase that
constructs a raw ``doctrine.service.DoctrineService`` — then wrap with
``charter.resolver.DoctrineService(inner, pack_context=None)``, the
sanctioned unfiltered-diagnostic form; see that module's docstring) and
``specify_cli/cli/commands/charter/generate.py`` (FR-002). The two former
"canonical" builders diverged on two axes; the unification always picks the
*fuller* behaviour on each:

* ``active_languages=infer_repo_languages(repo_root)`` is always computed
  (the pre-existing behaviour of :func:`_build_doctrine_service` below, i.e.
  this module's own prior behaviour). Issue #3292: this was, until then, an
  independent computation from ``charter.compiler.compile_charter``'s own
  ``catalog.languages`` stamp -- a compile with no active-language signal
  wrote a persisted empty list that this builder's *next* invocation of
  :func:`~charter.language_scope.infer_repo_languages` then read back as
  authoritative "admit none", degrading language-scoped styleguides/
  toolguides on the second and every subsequent ``charter generate``. Both
  call sites now route through the exact same function (``compile_charter``
  additionally passes its in-memory interview, which this builder --
  lacking one -- does not), so they can no longer diverge. See
  :func:`~charter.language_scope.infer_repo_languages`'s docstring for the
  full resolution contract.
* ``org_roots`` is always self-resolved via
  :func:`doctrine.drg.org_pack_config.resolve_org_roots` when a caller does
  not supply an explicit override (the prior behaviour of
  ``specify_cli.doctrine_service_factory``'s builder) — no caller can
  silently lose the org layer by omitting the argument.

Cycle note: :func:`_build_activation_aware_doctrine_service` calls
:func:`_build_doctrine_service` via a function-local
``from charter.context import _build_doctrine_service`` rather than a direct
intra-module reference. Several existing tests (e.g.
``tests/charter/test_context_include_activation.py::_patch_service``) patch
only ``charter.context._build_doctrine_service`` and rely on that single seam
covering BOTH the wrapped (agent-profile) and unwrapped paths — a guarantee
that held for free while both functions lived in ``charter.context`` itself.
Routing the inner call back through ``charter.context`` (which re-exports
this module's :func:`_build_doctrine_service` by reference) preserves that
single-patch-point contract after the relocation. :func:`_build_doctrine_service`
similarly resolves ``infer_repo_languages`` via a function-local import from
``charter.context`` — ``tests/charter/test_context.py`` patches
``charter.context.infer_repo_languages`` directly. The private
:func:`_build_activation_aware_doctrine_service` keeps its ``org_roots``
override parameter (unlike the new public function) precisely so this
existing patch seam and its callers (``charter.context``'s agent-profile
include branch, ``charter.profile_resolution``) are unaffected by the
unification.

    FR-016: ``charter context --include agent-profile:<id>`` must inherit the
    charter activation gate so that a non-activated profile is treated as a
    structured miss rather than silently rendered. This is the **scoped**
    counterpart to :func:`_build_doctrine_service`: it builds the same inner
    service (identical kwargs) and wraps it with the activation-aware
    :class:`charter.resolver.DoctrineService`, supplying a freshly constructed
    :class:`~charter.pack_context.PackContext` for *repo_root*.

    Only the ``agent-profile`` include branch routes through this helper; the
    other five callers of :func:`_build_doctrine_service` are deliberately left
    on the unwrapped service so their return type and behaviour are unchanged.

    Single builder contract (R5): the service is ALWAYS wrapped, even when
    ``activated_agent_profiles is None``. The wrapper's three-state filter
    treats ``None`` as "admit all", so the unrestricted case stays byte-identical
    in *behaviour* to the legacy fetch path while giving both activation-service
    builders one contract — ``_inner`` is always valid and ``.agent_profiles``
    is always a gated ``dict``.
