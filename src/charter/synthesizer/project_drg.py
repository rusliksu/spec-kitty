"""Project-level DRG overlay writer.

Thin composer over ``src/doctrine/drg`` primitives (KD-1 rule: no reusable
graph logic here — push any generic graph logic to ``src/doctrine/drg/``
instead).

Public API:

- ``emit_project_layer(targets, adapter_outputs, spec_kitty_version,
                       built_in_drg) -> DRGGraph``
  Builds a ``DRGGraph`` for the project-local overlay.  Raises
  ``ProjectDRGValidationError`` on additive-only violations (FR-020 / EC-6).

- ``persist(graph, staging_dir, guard)``
  Serializes the graph under ``staging_dir/doctrine`` via the supplied
  ``PathGuard``. The promote step (WP03) will move this file to the live
  project doctrine directory.

See data-model.md §E-5 for the overlay discipline.

    FR-020 / EC-6 additive-only enforcement:

    A target whose ``kind`` is not a synthesizable node kind (see

    both the previous manifest (untouched on disk) and the unlink already

    out-of-date manifest, but never a half-written manifest, never the
