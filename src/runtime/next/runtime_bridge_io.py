"""Narrow I/O ports for ``runtime.next.runtime_bridge`` (IC-04, #2531 WP05).

**Sole home of the narrow, near-mechanical I/O ports** IC-04 identifies: the
``feature-runs.json`` tracked-mission-to-run index (``load_feature_runs`` /
``save_feature_runs``), mission-runtime template/pack discovery, run
lifecycle (start / lookup), and the OperationalContext (OC) builder cluster.
Also hosts the two new port-shaped additions this WP introduces:

- ``gather_artifact_presence`` (T018, FR-009) — the fact-gathering counterpart
  of the guard inversion WP06 completes. It reads the SAME filesystem /
  status / bulk-edit / requirement-mapping facts ``_check_cli_guards``
  (still defined on ``runtime_bridge``, unmoved by this WP) /
  ``_check_composed_action_guard`` (moved to ``runtime_bridge_composition``
  by #2531 WP08; the residual keeps a thin compat delegate under the same
  name) read today, packaged as an
  :class:`ArtifactPresenceSnapshot`, so a future pure ``evaluate_guards``
  (WP06) can decide pass/fail without doing I/O itself. This function
  GATHERS ONLY — it makes no pass/fail decisions, and nothing in the current
  production call graph invokes it yet (wiring it in is WP06's job).
- ``resolve_commit_target`` (T019) — the ONE pure decision that was
  interleaved inside ``_wrap_with_decision_git_log`` (mid8 derivation +
  fail-closed validation + ``CommitTarget``/worktree_root-candidate
  selection). ``_wrap_with_decision_git_log`` itself is KEEP-IN-PLACE in the
  residual (contracts/compat-surface.md) — only its pure selection moved
  out; see that function's docstring for why the remaining ``.exists()``
  check stays a residual I/O concern.

``runtime_bridge.py`` keeps a **native thin compat delegate** — a real
``def``/``class`` statement, never a plain ``import`` alias — under every one
of the moved symbols the WP02 compat guard binds. This is mandatory, not
stylistic: ``tests/runtime/test_bridge_compat_surface.py::
test_guard_b_identity_reexport_for_relocated_symbols`` (a FROZEN gate file)
asserts that the set of compat symbols whose ``__module__`` differs from
``runtime_bridge`` equals a **hardcoded 3-element baseline** (the
pre-existing ``runtime.next.decision``-origin symbols). A plain re-export of
any OTHER compat-tracked symbol would flip that assertion and fail
deterministically — the exact mechanism WP04's ``runtime_bridge_retrospective``
docstring documents for its own 9 symbols. ``_feature_runs_path`` /
``save_feature_runs`` and the handful of names nothing patches (see each
function's docstring below) are untracked and therefore fine as plain
internal helpers with no residual shim at all.

**The intra-seam live-lookup risk (research.md §Compat / WP03-WP04
precedent).** Several of the moved, compat-tracked symbols call each other
now that they live together in this module (``get_or_start_run`` ->
``_load_feature_runs`` / ``_build_run_ref`` / ``_mission_key_for_run_ref`` /
``_runtime_template_key`` / ``_build_discovery_context``;
``_runtime_template_key`` -> ``_build_discovery_context`` /
``_resolve_runtime_template_in_root``; ``_start_ephemeral_query_run`` ->
``_runtime_template_key`` / ``_build_discovery_context``;
``_existing_run_ref`` -> ``_load_feature_runs`` / ``_build_run_ref``;
``build_operational_context_for_claim`` -> ``_resolve_run_dir_for_mission`` /
``_resolve_tech_stack_for_profile``; ``_build_operational_context_for_decision``
-> ``_resolve_tech_stack_for_profile``). Several ALSO call back into
compat-tracked names reachable at ``runtime_bridge.<name>`` — some still
natively defined in the residual (``_resolve_mission_ulid``,
``_resolve_runtime_feature_dir``, ``_has_raw_dependencies_field``,
``_check_requirement_mapping_ready``, ``_occurrence_gate_failures``), others
now thin compat delegates onto ``runtime_bridge_composition`` after #2531
WP08 (``_resolve_step_agent_profile``, ``_count_source_documented_events``,
``_publication_approved``) or plain re-exports from that same seam
(``_has_generated_docs``). Every one of these calls is routed through a
**local, live import of ``runtime_bridge``**
(``from runtime.next import runtime_bridge as _rb; _rb.<name>(...)``,
deferred to function scope — ``runtime_bridge`` imports this module at its
own top level, so a top-level back-import here would be circular) so a
``monkeypatch.setattr(runtime_bridge, "<name>", …)`` is still observed
exactly as before the extraction — the same false-green mitigation WP03's
``runtime_bridge_engine`` and WP04's ``runtime_bridge_retrospective`` already
apply. ``_build_discovery_context`` is the grounded high-risk case flagged by
``research.md`` §Compat (patched at ``test_query_mode_unit.py:751``, reached
only via intra-seam movers); the rule above closes it the same way it closes
every other compat-tracked intra-seam call in this module.

    """Resolve the per-type presence filename set for *mission_family* (FR-011, #3597).

    Sources filenames from the single per-type ``expected-artifacts.yaml``
    ``path_pattern`` authority (WP04's seam, #3599) -- the same authority
    :func:`specify_cli.runtime.resolver.required_artifacts_for` /
    :func:`~specify_cli.runtime.resolver.resolve_configured_artifact_name`
    draw from -- instead of the previously-closed 10-tuple literal this
    function replaces (``_PRESENCE_FILE_TAGS``).

    **Retired mirror (WP02, #3770, FR-005):** this function used to duplicate
    the org->built-in precedence + ``model_validate`` load logic locally. It
    now delegates to :func:`charter.activation.manifest_loader.load_manifest`
    (WP01's relocated, cached authority) for the manifest, and keeps ONLY the
    :func:`~charter.offering.missions.step_projection.project_artifact_name_set`
    -> ``frozenset`` projection step below.

    Family-scoped (every step's ``required_always`` + ``required_by_step``
    + ``optional_always`` path_patterns, unioned via
    ``project_artifact_name_set``), deliberately NOT filtered to the
    caller's ``step_id`` (byte-compat, NFR-003): the guard vocabulary
    calling this port is not uniform across mission families or dispatch
    paths. Software-dev's own manifest keys (mission.yaml state ids:
    specify/plan/tasks_outline/tasks_packages/tasks_finalize/...) match its
    CLI-native guard's ``step_id`` 1:1, but neither the *composed* ``"tasks"``
    action (no such manifest key -- disambiguated only by
    ``legacy_step_id``) nor the ``plan`` mission family's composed action
    names (``specify``/``plan``, vs. its own manifest's ``goals``/``draft``
    step keys) resolve correctly if this port filtered to one
    caller-supplied ``step_id``. Scanning the whole family set instead --
    exactly what the old global 10-tuple effectively did for every family
    it was blindly reused across -- avoids silently turning either mismatch
    into a spurious block. (A step-scoped design was tried during the WP04
    implementation and reverted after it red
    ``tests/runtime/test_bridge_parity.py::test_coverage_floor_is_met`` by
    incorrectly blocking the software-dev composed ``tasks`` guard and the
    ``plan``-family ``specify``/``plan`` guards even when their artifacts
    were present.)

    A custom mission family gates on its own filenames (AC-10) as long as
    it ships an ``expected-artifacts.yaml`` -- present -> passes, absent ->
    blocks -- regardless of which step is being gathered for; a family
    with no manifest resolves to an EMPTY ``frozenset()`` (never ``None`` --
    that is this projection's own absence output, distinct from the
    ``blocking_artifact_names`` tri-state :func:`_expected_artifacts_manifest_resolves`
    governs; see that function's docstring). The distinct guard-table
    *dispatch* fail-closed concern for a genuinely unregistered family is a
    separate, retained mechanism: ``runtime_bridge_cores.evaluate_guards_strict``
    still raises ``UnregisteredMissionFamilyError`` when ``_GUARD_TABLES``
    has no entry for the family (per the ADR).

    Every one of the 10 built-in filenames the old tuple hardcoded still
    resolves identically (NFR-003) -- see
    ``tests/specify_cli/runtime/test_configured_artifact_name.py`` for the
    per-(family, artifact_key) byte-compat characterization.

    FR-008: when *repo_root* is given and resolves to 1+ existing configured
    org roots, an org-pack ``<org_root>/missions/<mission_family>/expected-artifacts.yaml``
    takes precedence over the built-in file, whole-file -- never field-merged
    with it -- exactly as the authority implements (contract C-4). *repo_root*
    defaults to ``None`` (today's exact behavior: no org lookup, built-in
    tree only).

    Raises:
        ManifestSchemaError: A *found*, syntactically-valid manifest that
            fails schema validation (``extra="forbid"``) -- propagated
            unchanged from the authority, for BOTH tiers. Not caught here:
            this projection must not re-swallow it.
        MalformedManifestError: A *found* manifest that fails to parse as

    Derives ``mid8`` (:func:`specify_cli.lanes.branch_naming.resolve_mid8`, a
    pure string derivation), enforces the fail-closed mid8-required invariant
    for a coordination-routing mission, and computes the ``CommitTarget`` plus
    the worktree_root CANDIDATE the caller should land decisions on.

    No disk I/O: ``CoordinationWorkspace.worktree_path`` is documented as
    "Pure; no filesystem touch" — it only composes the path string. The ONE
    still-I/O-bearing decision — whether ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve()``'s
    verify-or-create side effects must run before trusting the candidate — is
    left to the caller (``_wrap_with_decision_git_log``, KEEP-IN-PLACE in the
    residual), which performs the ``.exists()`` stat itself: on success,
    ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve()`` always returns the identical path this
    function already computed (its ``path = cls.worktree_path(...)`` is the
    first line of every one of its branches), so deciding the FINAL
    ``worktree_root`` value here is safe — the caller's ``.exists()``-gated
    call only decides whether verification/creation side effects must happen
    first, never a different resulting value on success.

    Returns ``(mid8, worktree_root_candidate, decision_target)``. Raises
    :class:`runtime_bridge.DecisionGitLogUnavailable` (deferred import — the
    residual defines it; a top-level import here would be circular) when
    ``coord_routing_topology`` is True and no ``mid8`` can be resolved,
    exactly as the pre-extraction inline code did (still caught by the
    enclosing ``try/except`` in ``_wrap_with_decision_git_log``, so the
    existing double-wrap-into-DecisionGitLogUnavailable behavior for that
    path is unchanged).
