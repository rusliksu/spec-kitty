"""Shared write-target degrade helper (FR-005, C-004).

Unifies the ``_mission_meta_exists`` pre-gate and port-resolution logic across
three call sites, extracting a single kind-parameterized helper while preserving
each caller's distinct degrade policy (fail-open vs. fail-closed).

The three callers:
* ``decision_log._resolve_default_target`` (fail-open) — passes a concrete
  ``degrade_ref``; an unresolvable mission returns that ref.
* ``bookkeeping_commit._resolve_bookkeeping_commit_target`` (fail-closed) —
  passes ``degrade_ref=branch`` (which may be ``None``); an unresolvable
  mission with no ``branch`` raises ``ActionContextError``.
* ``status_transition._resolve_write_target`` (WP05, fail-closed) — adds pre-gate; preserves degrade

Resolution is always attempted FIRST regardless of ``degrade_ref`` — a
resolvable mission returns the placement-port target even when the caller
passed ``degrade_ref=None`` (fail-closed callers still get the real target
whenever one exists; ``degrade_ref``/the raise is consulted only once
resolution has genuinely failed). This preserves the pre-WP04 semantics of
the two callers this helper replaces.

See spec: FR-005, C-004; plan IC-06a, IC-06b.

    """Resolve write target via the placement port, or degrade to a caller-supplied ref.

    Unifies port-resolution + the ``_mission_meta_exists`` pre-gate (NOT the degrade
    policy). Each caller supplies its own ``degrade_ref`` so that fail-open vs.
    fail-closed behavior is preserved at the call site.

    Resolution is attempted first: when ``mission_slug`` has a ``meta.json`` and
    ``resolve_placement_only`` succeeds, its target is returned regardless of
    ``degrade_ref`` — including when ``degrade_ref`` is ``None``. ``degrade_ref``
    (or the fail-closed raise) is consulted only once resolution has actually
    failed (no ``meta.json`` yet, or a caught resolution error).

    Args:
        repo_root: Path to the primary git repository.
        mission_slug: The mission slug to resolve.
        kind: The artifact kind (determines partition routing: PRIMARY_METADATA → primary
            ``target_branch``; other kinds → topology-routed destination, e.g. COORD).
        effective_root: Issue 26 — the DECLARED owned checkout the caller is
            operating on (--owned-checkout), when one was given. Every placement
            and read lookup below folds to the primary by contract, so an owned
            mission's ``meta.json`` is invisible from the ambient root and this
            helper would degrade to the repo's generic default ref (typically the
            protected primary branch). Passing the owned root here makes the
            pre-gate AND the placement port resolve against the checkout the
            mission actually lives in. None (the default) reproduces the
            pre-existing primary-root behaviour byte-for-byte.
        degrade_ref: The ref to return if the mission cannot be resolved (no ``meta.json``
            yet, or an ad-hoc fixture outside a resolvable mission). The caller decides
            the policy: fail-open passes a concrete ref, fail-closed passes ``None`` to
            raise instead of silently degrading.

    Returns:
        A ``CommitTarget`` resolved for ``kind`` through the placement port, or
        ``CommitTarget(ref=degrade_ref)`` if the mission is not resolvable and
        ``degrade_ref`` is not ``None``.

    Raises:
        ``ActionContextError`` when the mission cannot be resolved AND
        ``degrade_ref`` is ``None`` (fail-closed policy — never silently
        degrades to a null ref). When a *caught-set* resolution failure
        (``ActionContextError`` / ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` / ``FileNotFoundError``)
        is what triggered the fail-closed path, the fresh ``ActionContextError``
        raised here preserves that failure's concrete ``error_code`` (or
        ``.code`` for an ``ActionContextError``) and chains it as the cause
        (``from exc``) — mirroring ``mission_runtime.resolution``'s own
        boundary-translation idiom (e.g. ``resolve_action_context`` /
        ``resolve_placement_only``: ``raise ActionContextError(exc.error_code,
        str(exc)) from exc``) — so a data-loss signal like
        ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` (a ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` subclass)
        never gets flattened into a generic, chain-less error. Only failures
        *outside* the caught set (ambiguous/malformed mission, etc.) propagate
        verbatim.
