# Managing the Issue Tracker

This guide describes how Spec Kitty structures its GitHub issue tracker so the
work graph stays honest, machine-navigable, and free of the drift that
hand-maintained checklists cause. It is aimed at maintainers and agents doing
tracker hygiene — parenting issues, wiring dependencies, and pruning stale
rollups.

The rules exist because a misleading work graph is expensive: a real defect
parented under a release rollup is hidden when that rollup is closed, and a
dependency captured only as prose is invisible to every tool that reads the
tracker.

## Functional epics versus meta-trackers

The tracker has two distinct kinds of parent issue. Telling them apart is the
first decision in any hygiene pass.

- A **functional epic** is a real domain or slice of work. It owns
  **native GitHub sub-issue children**, carries the `epic` label, and has a
  body that describes the work (see [Epic bodies](#epic-bodies-describe-work-not-children)).
- A **meta-tracker** is a convenience rollup — a release go/no-go list, a
  stabilization checklist, or a dashboard view. It carries the `meta-tracker`
  label, its body is a checklist that *references* issues owned elsewhere, and
  it has **no native children of its own**.

**The distinguishing test is native children, not the title.** An issue titled
`Umbrella: …` that owns native sub-issues is a functional epic; an issue that
holds only a body checklist of items homed under other epics is a
meta-tracker. Judge by the sub-issue graph, never by the name.

Parent functional issues under functional epics only. Never parent a real
work item under a meta-tracker.

## Parent and child are native sub-issue links

Express the parent/child relationship as a **native GitHub sub-issue link**, not
as a `## Children` checklist in the parent's body. Body checklists duplicate the
relationship and silently drift out of sync.

Create a link (REST — `sub_issue_id` is the child's numeric **database** id, not
its issue number):

```bash
CID=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<CHILD> --jq .id)
gh api --method POST repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<PARENT>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id="$CID"
```

Or via GraphQL (node ids, not numbers):

```bash
PID=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<PARENT> --jq .node_id)
CID=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<CHILD> --jq .node_id)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$c:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$c}){issue{number}}}' -f p="$PID" -f c="$CID"
```

List a parent's children with `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<PARENT>/sub_issues`.

**Single-parent constraint.** GitHub allows an issue only one parent; a second
link attempt returns HTTP 422. To **reparent**, remove the old link first, then
add the new one:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$c:ID!){removeSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$c}){issue{number}}}' -f p="$OLD_PARENT_NODE" -f c="$CHILD_NODE"
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$c:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$c}){issue{number}}}' -f p="$NEW_PARENT_NODE" -f c="$CHILD_NODE"
```

## Execution order is blocked_by, not prose

Encode sequencing as native `blocks` / `blocked_by` dependencies **between
children**, not as a `#A → #B → #C` sequence in the epic body. An epic body
should carry no ordering prose that a tool cannot read.

```bash
# REST — issue_id is the BLOCKING issue's numeric database id
gh api --method POST repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/<BLOCKED>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<BLOCKER_DB_ID>

# GraphQL — issueId is the BLOCKED issue's node id
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($b:ID!,$k:ID!){addBlockedBy(input:{issueId:$b,blockingIssueId:$k}){issue{number}}}' -f b="$BLOCKED_NODE" -f k="$BLOCKER_NODE"
```

For a strangler sequence of children, wire each step `blocked_by` its
predecessor so the ready-to-start item is always unambiguous.

## Epic bodies describe work, not children

An epic body is a functional description, not a child enumeration. Every epic
body must convey:

- **Why** — the problem or motivation.
- **For whom** — which users or roles benefit.
- **Intended effect** — the outcome once the epic is done.

Preserve substantive rationale; drop mechanical checklists (the sub-issue graph
already records the children).

## Meta-tracker lifecycle

- Label a meta-tracker `meta-tracker`, never `epic`.
- Its body checklist is by design. Do **not** audit a meta-tracker for
  "no in-body children" and do **not** native-link its checklist entries — the
  real issues live under their own epics.
- **Close a meta-tracker once it holds zero native sub-issues.** Its purpose is
  spent when the work it references is tracked under proper epics. Close it with
  an audit comment, and explicitly note any residual free-text checklist items
  so nothing silently vanishes.

## Filing children from an epic

When you decompose an epic into issues:

- **Match the epic's own stated breakdown** — file exactly the slices the body
  names, in the order it names them. Do not invent scope the epic did not
  specify; flag anything too vague to file cleanly instead of guessing.
- **Ground each slice in the real code first.** If a named slice already shipped,
  record that with evidence rather than filing a phantom "to-do" ticket that
  misrepresents completed work as pending.

## Triaging issues: type, severity, and release-blocking bugs

Every open issue carries two orthogonal classifications a triage pass must get
right: **what kind of thing it is** (native type) and **how urgent it is**
(priority). They are set independently and mean different things.

### Native type is the kind carrier

Set the GitHub **native issue type** — `Task`, `Bug`, or `Feature` (the tokens
are case-sensitive: `gh issue edit <N> --type Bug`). The type is the *sole* kind
carrier; the old `bug` label was retired repo-wide and must not be reintroduced.
A capability request wearing a bug title is a `Feature` (retype it, don't leave
it as a `Bug`). `enhancement` is a Feature, not a separate kind.

### Priority, and what makes a P0

Priority is a label (`priority:P0` … `priority:P3`). **`priority:P0` on a `Bug`
means a release-blocking defect** — and, per
[ADR 2026-07-17-1](../../adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1-red-main-is-honest-ci-is-release-authority.md),
that has teeth: **an open P0 bug is expected to red mainline**, mainline CI is the
authoritative release gate, and **red CI means no release**.

Because a P0 bug halts the release train, calibrate it deliberately. A bug is P0
if it trips any of:

- **Data/state corruption or loss** — overwrites recorded results, poisons/drops
  events, wrong-authority or split-brain committed writes.
- **Silent wrong result / false success** — a command reports success but skips or
  loses work (especially damning under the honesty ADR).
- **Core workflow broken with no workaround** — cannot implement / review / merge /
  accept / commit a mission; a deadlock or hang with no escape hatch.
- **Blocks release** directly, or a **security** exposure (credentials/secrets).

Downgrade below P0 when a clear workaround exists, the fault is edge-case-only,
cosmetic/UX, or confined to a dev-assist command. **Do not inflate P0** —
crying wolf devalues the red-mainline signal; and **do not under-call** a genuine
corruption or hang. Escalation to P0 is an operator decision.

Priority on a **non-bug** means something else: a `priority:P0` `Feature`/`Task`
is the priority of *planned work*, not a release-blocking defect — it does not
imply a red mainline.

### A P0 bug should carry a failing reproduction test

Per the ADR, when you file or accept a P0 bug, land an **issue-pinned red-first
reproduction test** so mainline honestly reflects the blocker rather than merely
asserting it. Mark it `@pytest.mark.regression` (the issue-pinned
exact-reproduction marker — **not** `quarantine`, which is built to *never* red
main), reproduce the defect through the pre-existing entry point, and note in the
test that it is an intentional red-first P0 reproduction referencing its tracking
issue. It must fail because of the product defect, not a test error — a
false red corrupts the signal it exists to give. Expensive QA and manual testing
wait for green; maintainers prioritize red recovery. See the
[red-main policy](../reference/red-main-and-release-readiness.md).

### What "good first issue" means here

`good first issue` is **not** a difficulty or seniority signal — this project's
contributor base is senior by default. It marks a **good entry point into the
codebase**: a self-contained issue that teaches a subsystem while carrying **low
customer and blast-radius impact**, so someone new to the repo can land it
without first absorbing deep cross-cutting context.

Reach for it when an issue is well-scoped, has a clear deliverable, and touches a
peripheral or tooling surface rather than a load-bearing one. One guardrail: if a
`good first issue` could still alter a **blocking or shared gate** (or otherwise
carry real blast radius despite being a good entry point), require maintainer
concurrence on the chosen approach **before** implementation — normal PR review
then covers the rest.
