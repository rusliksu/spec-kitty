# Running the test suite in parallel

The Spec Kitty test suite runs safely in parallel locally and in CI, typically
at least 2× faster on a machine with four or more cores. This page explains the
one correct local command, why it is shaped the way it is, and how to reproduce
the coverage-neutrality gates CI uses.

For what to do when a test goes red on CI *unrelated to your diff* — budget gates
vs. correctness flakes vs. environmental flakes, and why we never retry-to-green —
see the [test-flakiness handling policy](testing-flakiness.md).

## The local command

```bash
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/ -n auto --dist loadfile -p no:cacheprovider
# daemon/real-port tests run serially:
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py -n0 -q
```

The first command runs the bulk of the suite across worker processes. The second
command runs the daemon/real-port tests serially. Run both; the parallel command
deliberately leaves the serial-only tests for the second pass.

## Why `--dist loadfile` (never bare `--dist load`)

`pytest-xdist` supports several distribution modes. We always use `loadfile`:

- **`loadfile`** keeps every test that lives in the same file on a single
  worker. File-scoped fixtures (`scope="module"`, file-level collection
  ordering, shared module state) keep working exactly as they do serially.
- **`load`** (the bare default) scatters a single file's tests across multiple
  workers. That breaks file-scoped fixtures and any test that relies on
  collection order within a file.

For that reason: **always pass `--dist loadfile`; never use bare `--dist
load`.** CI uses `loadfile` for the same reason.

`-p no:cacheprovider` disables pytest's cache plugin so a parallel run never
races on the shared `.pytest_cache` directory.

## Per-worker HOME isolation (the master enabler)

A parallel run **never touches the real `~/.spec-kitty`**. Each `pytest-xdist`
worker — and the serial "master" run when you omit `-n auto` — gets its own
isolated home directory. The isolation is set up in `tests/conftest.py`:

- `pytest_configure` points `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` and the XDG dirs
  (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`) at a per-worker base
  **before collection**, so modules that bind a home-derived path at import time
  (for example `specify_cli.sync.daemon.SPEC_KITTY_DIR`) resolve into the
  isolated home.
- An autouse, function-scoped fixture re-asserts the `HOME` / `USERPROFILE` / XDG
  env vars for every test, keyed by worker id, so call-time `Path.home()` reads
  are isolated too. It does **not** monkeypatch `Path.home` (that approach was the
  cycle-1 regression that broke ~16 `tests/sync` cases — the fixture relies on
  `Path.home()` natively resolving `HOME` via `expanduser`), so a test that sets
  up its own tmp home via `setenv('HOME', ...)` cleanly overrides the per-worker
  baseline.

The per-worker base is keyed by the xdist test-run UID and the worker id, so two
workers in the same run get distinct homes (no collision) and successive runs do
not reuse stale state. The regression guard
`tests/architectural/test_real_home_isolation_guard.py` (SC-006) and
`tests/test_worker_home_isolation.py` prove this invariant.

Because the real `~/.spec-kitty` is never bound, you do not need to back it up or
worry about a parallel run truncating your real `queue.db`.

## The serial daemon pass

Per-worker HOME isolation protects per-user state, but it does **not** protect
OS-global resources such as real TCP ports or singleton daemons. Tests that bind
the reserved daemon port range (9400–9449) — `tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py` —
must run in their own serial pass:

```bash
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py -n0 -q
```

`-n0` forces serial execution even when xdist is installed. These tests are
excluded from the parallel pool so two workers never contend for the same port.

## Volume env gates (`SPEC_KITTY_ULID_VOLUME_FULL`)

Some tests exercise large-volume ULID generation. By default they run at a
**reduced** scale so the local default stays fast; the full scale is reachable
via an env gate (and is exercised on the nightly/full path). The assertion logic
is identical across scales — only the volume changes.

```bash
pytest <ulid_test> -q                               # reduced (fast, default)
SPEC_KITTY_ULID_VOLUME_FULL=1 pytest <ulid_test> -q  # full (nightly parity)
```

## Running the stability ratchet locally

Before any shard is flipped to parallel, it must pass the stability ratchet
(C-RATCHET): N consecutive green parallel runs with no new flakes. The same
entrypoint CI uses is available locally (the WP02 coverage-safety harness):

```bash
python -m tests._support.coverage_safety.ratchet -n 3 -- tests/agent -m "not slow"
```

Exit code `0` means all N runs were green and the flip is accepted; `1` means it
was rejected and the summary names any new or flaky failures. The Python API is
`run_ratchet(...)` from `tests._support.coverage_safety`. See
`tests/_support/coverage_safety/README.md` for the full harness (collection
equivalence and anti-vacuity mutation checks).

## Validate the acceleration (copy-pasteable)

These are the mission's reproducible validation steps. Run them from the repo
root to confirm the parallel run is coverage-neutral and at least 2× faster than
serial. (`.venv/bin/pytest` is the synced project interpreter; substitute
`pytest` if you run it directly.)

```bash
# 1. Serial baseline (whole-suite wall clock) and a per-shard nodeid reference.
time .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider     # serial baseline
.venv/bin/pytest tests/charter --collect-only -q | sort > /tmp/charter-serial.nodeids

# 2. Collection equivalence: serial vs parallel must collect identical nodeids.
.venv/bin/pytest tests/charter -n auto --dist loadfile --collect-only -q \
  | sort > /tmp/charter-par.nodeids
diff /tmp/charter-serial.nodeids /tmp/charter-par.nodeids   # must be empty

# 3. Stability ratchet: 3 consecutive green parallel runs (the same gate CI uses).
python -m tests._support.coverage_safety.ratchet -n 3 -- \
  tests/charter -m "fast and not windows_ci"

# 4. Parallel-vs-serial timing: target ≥2× faster on a ≥4-core machine.
time PWHEADLESS=1 .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -n auto --dist loadfile -p no:cacheprovider \
  --deselect tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py
time PWHEADLESS=1 .venv/bin/pytest tests/sync/test_orphan_sweep.py -n0 -q   # serial pass

# 5. Real home untouched: mtime/inode unchanged (or path still absent) after the run.
ls -la ~/.spec-kitty 2>/dev/null
```

## CI shard-topology mission status

Point-in-time mission-status snapshots (named mission IDs, CI-confirmation state, and
per-job PENDING wall-clock records for the `ci-test-topology-performance-01KXBJRT`
shard-topology re-flip) have moved to
[`testing-parallel-ci-topology-status.md`](../../plans/engineering-notes/testing-parallel-ci-topology-status.md)
in engineering notes — this how-to page stays focused on the durable local workflow above.

## Reproducing #3115 (the folded-uuid render-width defect)

`sync status` / `sync doctor` render a `Project` column with `overflow="fold"`
(`src/specify_cli/cli/commands/sync.py:1440`, deliberate). At an 80-column
console width a 36-character project uuid folds across two lines and stops
being a contiguous substring of the captured output, so a plain `uuid in out`
assertion fails even though the journal is fully populated. The 80-column
width comes from `rich.console.Console.size`'s `if self.is_dumb_terminal:`
branch, which returns the hardcoded `ConsoleDimensions(80, 25)` **above** the
`COLUMNS` read — so `COLUMNS`, which the affected tests' isolation fixture
already sets, is never consulted. `is_terminal` is true whenever `FORCE_COLOR`
is set to a non-empty value, and `is_dumb_terminal` additionally requires
`TERM` to be `dumb` or `unknown`.

This is reproduced with two environment variables, one victim file, one
process — no `pytest-xdist`, because `--dist loadfile`'s worker assignment is
dynamic and work-stealing, so a reproducer that depends on a particular
assignment would not be reproducible by construction.

```bash
TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1 ./scripts/repro_3115_render_width.sh
```

This runs `tests/cli/commands/test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py` (4
collected tests) alone, in one process, and reds with:

```
FAILED tests/cli/commands/test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py::test_status_names_every_project_with_count_age_and_consent
AssertionError: aaaaaaaa-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 is in the journal but `status` did not name it
1 failed, 3 passed in ~46-56s
```

The sibling victim file reproduces the same defect independently:

```bash
TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1 ./scripts/repro_3115_render_width.sh doctor
```

`tests/cli/commands/test_sync_doctor_per_project_3030.py` collects **12**
tests and reds `1 failed, 11 passed`, with assertion text
`aaaaaaaa-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 is in the journal but doctor did not
name it` (no backticks around `doctor` — the two victim files' f-strings are
not identical, so quote each one's text verbatim rather than assuming they
match).

Only the first of the three seeded projects (`CONSENTED`,
`aaaaaaaa-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`) demonstrates the defect: the other two
(`SILENT`, `OPTED_OUT`) pass at width 80 anyway, via an un-tabled warning
paragraph that reprints their identity outside the folding table.
`Queue 0 event(s)` / `Queue size 0 / 100,000` appear in the captured output
regardless of outcome (`OfflineQueue().size()`, `sync.py:5182-5185`) — they
are **not** a signature of this defect and must not be read as one.

Both counted lines are collected-count-relative: `test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py`
collects 4 (red is `1 failed, 3 passed`), `test_sync_doctor_per_project_3030.py`
collects 12 (red is `1 failed, 11 passed`). A count line that does not
reconcile against its file's own `--collect-only -q` count is not evidence.

**Control** — the same command plus `TTY_COMPATIBLE=0` must PASS. This is what
distinguishes "the width is the cause" from "this file is just broken":

```bash
TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1 TTY_COMPATIBLE=0 ./scripts/repro_3115_render_width.sh
# 4 passed
TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1 TTY_COMPATIBLE=0 ./scripts/repro_3115_render_width.sh doctor
# 12 passed
```

**Determinism** is not established by repetition alone: `pytest-randomly` is
not installed on this tree, so nothing randomises order and "the same node-id
comes up red three times in a row" is trivially true regardless of whether the
red is order-dependent. The clause that can actually fail is running the
failing case **alone, by node-id**, with no file-siblings collected first:

```bash
TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1 python3 -m pytest \
  "tests/cli/commands/test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py::test_status_names_every_project_with_count_age_and_consent"
# 1 failed, collected count 1, identical assertion text
```

A red that needs its file-siblings to run first would be order-dependent and
would not be reproducible by construction (C-004).

`./scripts/repro_3115_render_width.sh` computes its own repo root from its own
location and sets `PYTHONPATH` to that repo's `src/` before invoking pytest.
This matters in a `git worktree`: the shared `.venv`'s
`_editable_impl_spec_kitty_cli.pth` holds the **main checkout's** absolute
`src` path, so a bare `pytest` run inside a worktree using that `.venv`
silently imports the main checkout's live tree instead of the worktree's own
source. The script's `PYTHONPATH` line exists specifically to defeat that.

The whole reproducer (one victim file, one process) completes in well under 2
minutes (measured around 46-59s per file on this codebase's base commit,
`bb2020fea9`) — cheap enough that nothing downstream needs to take the defect
on faith.
