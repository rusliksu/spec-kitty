# Red Main and Release Readiness

This guide states, in operational terms, what a red `main` means and how the team acts on it. The governing decision is [ADR 2026-07-17-1](../../adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1-red-main-is-honest-ci-is-release-authority.md), accepted by consensus (CEO/product owner, QA lead, maintainers).

The one-line stance: **it's broken, we hate it, but it's the truth, so we do not hide it.** An honest red is worth more than a convenient green.

## What a red main means

A red `main` is a **true signal**, not a workflow violation. It means mainline CI has found one or more known release-blocking (**P0**) defects. We do **not** keep `main` green by hiding failures — reverting an honest red or declining to merge a bug's reproduction test would produce a *green-washed* mainline that lies to everyone building on it.

A red `main` should always be **traceable to an accepted P0**: a filed issue, ideally with a failing test that reproduces the defect.

## CI status is the release authority

**Mainline CI status is authoritative for release readiness. Red CI means no release.**

- No release is cut while mainline CI is red — there is no "known-red, ship anyway" path.
- Because CI is the single gate, it must mean one thing. That is exactly why we refuse to green-wash: a CI signal that is sometimes decorative is authoritative for nothing.

See the release process in [CONTRIBUTING](../contributing.md); this guide governs *whether* a release may proceed, which is gated on green mainline CI.

## Filing or accepting a P0: add a failing test

When you file or accept a P0 bug, you are **free and encouraged** to land a test that reproduces it — a red-first reproduction at mainline scope.

- A P0 that carries a failing test is unambiguous, self-documenting, and impossible to lose track of. A P0 described only in prose drifts and gets rediscovered downstream.
- Turning `main` red this way is **honouring the process, not breaking it.** The red is the point: it makes the defect visible until it is fixed.
- This is the mainline-scope extension of the red-first / never-retry-to-green discipline already applied per-PR — see [test-flakiness handling](../testing/testing-flakiness.md) and the red classification bins in the [PR-landing runbook](../how-to/pr-landing.md).

## Expensive QA and manual testing wait for green

**Expensive QA runs and internal manual testing do not execute on a red mainline build.** There is no value in validating a base that is already known-broken; that effort waits until `main` is green. This protects scarce QA and human-tester time from being spent certifying a base whose result is already known.

## Maintainers prioritize red builds

Green `main` is the goal. A red `main` is **not an acceptable resting state** — it is an alarm that pulls to the front of the maintainer queue.

- Treat mainline recovery as top priority; do not let "red is allowed" erode into "red is tolerated."
- Land the fix through the normal PR flow (no-direct-push is unchanged — see [Keep Main Clean](../../guides/how-to/missions/keep-main-clean.md)); this policy governs what a red CI *means*, not how commits arrive.
- The landing-pass runbook's [red-classification step](../how-to/pr-landing.md#4-classify-every-red-check) tells you how to tell a genuine P0 red from a flake or a pre-existing breakage while you work the queue.
