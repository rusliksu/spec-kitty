# 2.x ADR Coverage

## Audit Summary

A fresh-clone audit compared `docs/adr/2.x/` against current 2.x code surfaces.

Result:

1. Runtime and status/event areas were already covered by ADRs.
2. Doctrine artifact governance and living glossary architecture were implemented but undocumented.
3. This gap is closed by new ADRs dated `2026-02-23`.

## Coverage Matrix

| Code Surface | ADR Coverage |
|---|---|
| `src/specify_cli/runtime/*` and canonical `next` loop | `2026-02-17-1`, `2026-02-17-2`, `2026-02-17-3` |
| Status/event-lifecycle model | `2026-02-09-1`, `2026-02-09-3`, `2026-04-06-1`, `2026-05-01-1` plus the superseded history in `2026-02-09-2` and `2026-04-03-2` |
| Doctrine artifact model (`src/doctrine/**`, charter compiler/commands) | `2026-02-23-1` |
| Living glossary model (`glossary/**`, glossary hook integration) | `2026-02-23-2` |
