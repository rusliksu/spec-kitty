# 1.x Orchestration and API Boundary

`1.x` uses a host/provider split for automated orchestration:

1. `spec-kitty` owns workflow state and transition validation.
2. External providers run orchestration loops.
3. Providers integrate through `spec-kitty orchestrator-api` only.

## What changed

1. `spec-kitty orchestrate` is not part of the core CLI.
2. `spec-kitty orchestrator-api` is the supported host contract.
3. `spec-kitty-orchestrator` is the reference external provider.

## Recommended operator flow

```bash
spec-kitty orchestrator-api contract-version
spec-kitty-orchestrator orchestrate --mission 034-my-feature --dry-run
spec-kitty-orchestrator orchestrate --mission 034-my-feature
```

## Build-your-own provider

Custom providers should:

1. Read ready work through `list-ready` / `feature-state`.
2. Start work through `start-implementation`.
3. Drive review loops with `transition` and `start-review`.
4. Finalize with `accept-mission` and `merge-mission`.

Do not mutate WP lane frontmatter directly from the provider process.
