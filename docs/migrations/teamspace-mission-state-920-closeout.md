# TeamSpace Mission-State #920 Closeout Evidence

Generated from clean workspace
`spec-kitty-20260510-191702-gGiW54`.

## Current conclusion

Do not close `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty#920` yet.

The CLI repair/import-readiness implementation is now covered, and this branch
closes the remaining spec-kitty implementation/documentation gaps found in
`#923`, `#925`, `#931`, `#935`, and `#978`. The parent epic still has real
operational and cross-repo work outside this branch:

- `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty#979` is open: the actual coordinated repair commits
  have not been run across active repositories.
- Active repository audits still report TeamSpace blockers:
  - `spec-kitty`: 140 missions, 86 missions with TeamSpace blockers, 2455
    total blockers.
  - `spec-kitty-saas`: 48 missions, 33 missions with TeamSpace blockers, 1773
    total blockers.
  - `spec-kitty-events`: 18 missions, 15 missions with TeamSpace blockers, 499
    total blockers.
- `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty-runtime#17` is still open.
- `Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty-saas#143`, `#144`, `#145`, and `#146` are still open.

## Evidence by issue

| Issue | Status | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| spec-kitty `#921` audit engine | implemented | `tests/audit -q` passed: 174 tests. |
| spec-kitty `#922` CLI audit command | implemented | `tests/audit/test_audit_cli.py` covered `--audit`, `--json`, `--mission`, `--fail-on`, and `--include-fixtures`. |
| spec-kitty `#923` identity ADR | implemented on this branch | ADR added at `docs/adr/3.x/2026-05-10-1-deterministic-historical-mission-state-repair.md`; fork-seed behavior covered in `test_deterministic_repair_ids_follow_fork_seed_material`. |
| spec-kitty `#924` local canonicalizer | implemented | `tests/migration/test_mission_state_repair.py` covers canonicalization, idempotency, deterministic IDs, event preservation, quarantine, and manifest evidence. |
| spec-kitty `#925` distributed Git safety | implemented on this branch | Added tests for held common-dir lock and dirty relevant paths in a linked worktree. No commit mode exists, so path-whitelisted staging is not applicable. |
| spec-kitty `#926` deterministic public migration | implemented | Two-clone rehearsal verifies byte-identical diffs and deterministic dry-run output. |
| spec-kitty `#927` TeamSpace dry-run | closed | Dry-run validates against `spec-kitty-events` 5.0.0 and reports row mappings/side logs. |
| spec-kitty `#928` side logs | implemented | Dry-run reports decision/runtime/mission side logs with skipped disposition; audit/dry-run prevent them being reduced as status transitions. |
| spec-kitty `#929` fixture pack | implemented | Packaged and test fixtures are exercised by `tests/audit`. |
| spec-kitty `#930` manifest | implemented | `RepairReport` records schema version, run id, repo head, targets, file checksums, row transformations, quarantine counts, and validation results. |
| spec-kitty `#931` sync/import guardrail | implemented on this branch | `teamspace_dry_run` now blocks on audit blockers before envelope synthesis; batch sync rejects historical mission-state fields before network POST. |
| spec-kitty `#932` rehearsal | closed | `tests/migration/test_teamspace_migration_rehearsal.py` passes with `spec-kitty-events` 5.0.0. |
| spec-kitty `#933` operator runbook | implemented | `docs/migrations/teamspace-mission-state-repair.md`. |
| spec-kitty `#934` CI readiness gate | closed | `.github/workflows/teamspace-mission-state-readiness.yml`. |
| spec-kitty `#935` release sequencing | implemented on this branch | Release sequencing section added to the runbook. |
| spec-kitty `#978` events dependency | implemented on this branch | `pyproject.toml` now requires `spec-kitty-events>=5.0.0,<6.0.0`; `uv.lock` resolves 5.0.0 from PyPI; release metadata advanced to `3.2.0rc5`. |
| spec-kitty `#979` actual repair commit | open | Not done. Audits above prove the active repositories still need coordinated repair commits. |
| spec-kitty-events `#18`, `#19`, `#20` | closed | GitHub state is closed; local dependency now resolves `spec-kitty-events` 5.0.0. |
| spec-kitty-tracker `#13` | closed | Existing issue comments record focused tracker verification: canonical TeamSpace/no-rollout tests passed. |
| spec-kitty-saas `#149` | closed | GitHub state is closed. |
| spec-kitty-saas `#143`-`#146` | open | Still open in GitHub and listed by the parent epic. |
| spec-kitty-runtime `#17` | open | Still open in GitHub and listed by the parent epic. |
