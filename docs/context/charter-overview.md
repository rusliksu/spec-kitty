# How Charter Works

Charter is the governance layer that turns your project's structured policy file
(`.kittify/charter/charter.yaml`) into context that every agent mission action automatically
receives. This page explains the mental model — synthesis, the DRG, governed context, and profile
invocation. For the complete, step-by-step create-your-charter flow (interview through
generation, validation, and synthesis), see
[How to Set Up Project Governance](../guides/how-to/governance/setup-governance.md). For the guided tour connecting
setup to a full mission run, see the
[Governed Charter Workflow Tutorial](../guides/tutorials/charter-governed-workflow.md).

> **Key invariant**: `.kittify/charter/charter.yaml` is the git-tracked, authoritative,
> structured charter — `governance`, `directives`, `catalog`, activation, and `overrides` all
> live inside it. `governance`, `directives`, activation, and `overrides` are hand-authored (or
> interview-seeded); `catalog` and `metadata` are refreshed deterministically by
> `charter generate`. `.kittify/charter/charter.md` is a **curated companion**: a human-readable
> narrative the runtime never parses, scrapes, or resolves policy from — editing it has no
> runtime effect. A project may also keep a public constitution or governance document outside
> `.kittify/`; both `charter.md` and any external document are supporting context, not alternate
> authoritative charter paths. `.kittify/config.yaml` carries a single `charter:` pointer that
> resolves the active `charter.yaml`. Do not hand-edit `charter.yaml`'s `catalog` or `metadata`
> sections, synthesis manifests, or provenance sidecars. Agent synthesis input under
> `.kittify/charter/generated/` is produced by the harness, not by routine operator edits.

## What Charter Does

Charter solves a specific problem: agent prompts need consistent, project-accurate policy context,
sourced from one operator-controlled, machine-readable charter file.

The mechanism:

1. You author (directly, or via interview + `charter generate`) the `governance`, `directives`,
   and activation sections of `.kittify/charter/charter.yaml` — testing standards, quality gates,
   branching rules, directive selections, activated doctrine kinds.
2. `charter generate` refreshes `charter.yaml`'s `catalog` and `metadata` sections (the doctrine
   reference manifest and a generation timestamp) from the current doctrine selection, merging
   the refresh back into the file without touching your authored sections.
3. When `spec-kitty next` invokes an agent profile for a mission action, the runtime reads
   `charter.yaml` directly and injects the relevant charter context into the prompt automatically.
   The agent does not invent governance; it reads and complies with what the charter says.

`charter.md` plays no role in that resolution path. Keep it as a narrative companion — a
human-facing summary of the same policy, or a pointer to a public constitution — but editing it
does not change runtime behavior.

## Synthesis Flow

At a high level, the Charter setup flow is: capture policy decisions via interview, generate (or
refresh) `charter.yaml`, check for graph-native decay, synthesize doctrine into
`.kittify/doctrine/`, validate the bundle against the `CharterBundleManifest` v2.0.0 schema, and
confirm status shows no drift. For the complete command-by-command walkthrough — including flags,
what each command outputs, and how to recover from a stale bundle — follow
[How to Set Up Project Governance](../guides/how-to/governance/setup-governance.md) rather than reproducing the
sequence here.

**`charter context`** is a separate runtime/debug command for rendering action-specific
governance context for a specific workflow action. It is not part of the generation pipeline:

```bash
# Render what governance context an agent would receive for the 'implement' action
uv run spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json
```

To change runtime policy by hand, edit `charter.yaml`'s `governance:` or `directives:` sections
directly. There is no separate sync step: the next `charter context` call reads the file as-is.
`charter sync` still exists for canonical-root resolution and back-compat call sites, but it no
longer extracts anything from `charter.md` — running it is always a no-op.

For partial regeneration of a specific directive or tactic without touching unrelated artifacts:

```bash
uv run spec-kitty charter resynthesize --topic directive:PROJECT_001
```

## The DRG-Backed Context Model

The charter bundle is not a flat file — it is backed by a **Directive Relationship Graph (DRG)**.
The DRG is a directed graph whose nodes are directives, tactics, and glossary terms, and whose
edges use typed relations such as `scope`, `requires`, `suggests`, `vocabulary`, `instantiates`,
`replaces`, and `delegates_to`.

When `spec-kitty next` prepares a prompt for a mission action (for example, `implement`), the
runtime traverses the DRG from the entry point for that action and collects the relevant subgraph.
This is **governed profile invocation**: the agent receives a `(profile, action, governance-context)`
triple, where the governance context is the DRG-derived subgraph rendered as structured text.

The agent cannot see or modify the DRG directly. It receives the rendered context and acts in
accordance with the directives it finds there.

## External Governance Documents

Projects that already publish governance outside `.kittify/`, for example
`spec/constitution.md`, should keep that public document in place and reference it from
`.kittify/charter/charter.yaml`. Spec Kitty does not require the public document, `charter.yaml`,
and `charter.md` to be byte-for-byte equal — `charter.yaml` is the only one the runtime resolves.

Declare supporting docs under `governance.doctrine.governance_references` in `charter.yaml`
(the interview's equivalent answer writes into this same section):

```yaml
governance:
  doctrine:
    governance_references:
      - spec/constitution.md
```

`spec-kitty charter context --action ...` renders these paths as required governance reading.
`spec-kitty charter status` reports missing or unsafe references so operators can fix stale paths.
All referenced paths must be repository-relative and stay inside the repo root.

---

## Bootstrap vs Compact Context

The DRG traversal for a given action can produce large context payloads for complex projects.

- **Bootstrap mode**: the first time an action loads context (or when the charter is freshly
  generated), the runtime injects the full relevant DRG subgraph. The agent sees all applicable
  directives and tactics.
- **Compact-context mode**: when the DRG context payload is too large to include in full, the
  runtime falls back to a summarized view — resolved paradigms, directives, and tool list only,
  without the full library text. This is a known limitation (see issue #787 in the project tracker;
  check that issue for current resolution status).

Do not assume full-context behavior unconditionally. Large governance layers may trigger
compact-context mode, causing agents to receive less detail.

## Key Governance Files

| File | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `.kittify/charter/charter.yaml` | **Human** (`governance`/`directives`/activation/`overrides`); `charter generate` (`catalog`/`metadata` only) | The single git-tracked, authoritative structured charter |
| `.kittify/charter/charter.md` | **Human** | Curated narrative companion; never parsed by the runtime |
| `.kittify/config.yaml` | **Human**; `charter:` pointer minted once at bootstrap | Points to the active `charter.yaml`; also holds `org_packs` |
| `.kittify/charter/generated/` | Agent harness | Candidate doctrine YAML consumed by `charter synthesize` |
| `.kittify/charter/synthesis-manifest.yaml` | Auto-generated (`charter synthesize`) | Manifest for promoted project-local doctrine artifacts |
| `.kittify/charter/provenance/*.yaml` | Auto-generated (`charter synthesize`) | Provenance sidecars for synthesized doctrine artifacts |
| `.kittify/doctrine/` | Auto-generated (synthesize) | Project-local doctrine promoted by synthesizer |
