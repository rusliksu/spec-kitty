# How to Generate Work Packages

Use this guide to turn a plan into work packages with `/spec-kitty.tasks`.

`/spec-kitty.tasks` translates implementation concerns (IC-## entries) from `plan.md`
into executable work packages. One concern may become multiple WPs; multiple small
concerns may merge into a single WP. Each generated WP should cite the implementation
concern(s) it addresses via `plan_concern_refs` in `wps.yaml`.

## Prerequisites

- `kitty-specs/<feature>/plan.md` exists
- All `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items are resolved
- You are in the repository root checkout
- Task artifacts are committed to the mission's target branch

## The Command

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.tasks
```

## What Gets Created

- `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks.md` (overview checklist)
- `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/WP01-*.md`, `WP02-*.md`, ... (prompt files)

Work packages live in a **flat** `tasks/` directory. Lane status is stored in each prompt file frontmatter via `lane: "planned"`.

## Understanding Work Packages

Each WP file contains:
- A single goal for the agent
- Subtasks and dependencies
- The exact completion command to move the WP to review

## Finalizing Tasks

After reviewing the generated WPs, finalize the task set.

In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty agent mission finalize-tasks
```

## Example Output

```
kitty-specs/012-feature/tasks.md
kitty-specs/012-feature/tasks/WP01-auth-backend.md
kitty-specs/012-feature/tasks/WP02-auth-ui.md
kitty-specs/012-feature/tasks/WP03-tests.md
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing plan**: Run `/spec-kitty.plan` first.
- **Tasks look incomplete**: Resolve clarifications in `plan.md` and rerun `/spec-kitty.tasks`.
- **Wrong directory**: Run from the repository root checkout.
- **Wrong target branch**: Re-check `spec-kitty agent mission branch-context --json` before regenerating tasks.
