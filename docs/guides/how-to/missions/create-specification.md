# How to Create a Feature Specification

Use this guide to capture a new feature specification with `/spec-kitty.specify`.

## When to Use

Run this when you are starting a brand-new feature and need a spec before planning or implementation.

## The Command

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.specify <description>
```

Run it from the repository root checkout. Planning artifacts are created in `kitty-specs/` on the mission's target branch, and no worktrees are created during specify. If you do not pass `--target-branch`, Spec Kitty uses the current branch.

When you run the direct CLI form (`spec-kitty specify <description>`), it creates the mission scaffold and marks the result as scaffold-only. Fill `spec.md` with the complete specification before running `spec-kitty plan --mission <mission>`.

## The Discovery Interview

After the command, the CLI interviews you for missing details. You must answer each question before the spec is generated. Expect the agent to respond with `WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY_INPUT` until the interview is complete.

## What Gets Created

- `kitty-specs/###-feature/spec.md`
- `kitty-specs/###-feature/meta.json`
- `kitty-specs/###-feature/checklists/requirements.md`

## Example

```text
/spec-kitty.specify Build a photo organizer that groups albums by date and supports drag-and-drop reordering.
```

During discovery, answer follow-up questions (roles, constraints, success criteria). Once complete, write the specification content to `kitty-specs/<feature>/spec.md` on the mission's target branch.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck on discovery**: Answer the remaining interview questions. The spec will not be created until the interview is complete.
- **Wrong directory**: Run from the repository root checkout, not from a worktree.
- **Wrong landing branch**: Check `spec-kitty agent mission branch-context --json` before creating the mission, or pass `--target-branch <branch>` explicitly.
- **Need to revise the spec**: Re-run `/spec-kitty.specify` with the updated description and follow the interview again.
