# How to implement a work package

Use this guide to implement a single work package (WP) in its execution workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Tasks have been generated and finalized
- You know the WP ID (for example, `WP01`)

## Step 1: Get the WP Prompt

Use the slash command in your agent (recommended):

```text
/spec-kitty.implement
```

Or run the workflow command directly:

```bash
spec-kitty agent action implement WP01 --agent <agent>
```

This moves the WP to `lane: "doing"` and prints the full prompt plus the completion command.

## Step 2: Create or Resolve the Workspace

The canonical way is via the agent loop (recommended):

```bash
spec-kitty next --agent <agent> --mission <slug>
```

Your agent will call `spec-kitty agent action implement WP01 --agent <name>` for each WP, which resolves the correct execution lane workspace automatically.

> **Advanced / internal tool**: `spec-kitty implement WP01` is available as a lower-level direct invocation for advanced users. Prefer `spec-kitty next` for the standard workflow.

If the WP depends on another WP, task finalization will already have assigned it to the correct execution lane. Both the agent loop and the direct invocation handle this automatically.

## Step 3: Work in the Resolved Worktree

In your terminal:

```bash
cd <path printed by spec-kitty agent action implement>
```

Implement the prompt, run required tests, and commit your changes in that workspace. Sequential WPs in the same lane reuse the same worktree, for example `.worktrees/###-feature-lane-a`.

## Step 4: Mark the WP Ready for Review

Use the exact command printed in the prompt. In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to for_review --note "Ready for review: <summary>"
```

## What Happens

- An execution workspace is created or reused for the WP (`.worktrees/###-feature-lane-a/`)
- The WP lane is updated to `doing`
- Dependencies are enforced through lane computation in `finalize_tasks`

> **Note**: Spec Kitty creates one git worktree per execution lane. If task finalization computes one lane, the feature uses one worktree.

## Troubleshooting

- **"lanes.json is required"**: Run task finalization before implementation.
- **"WP missing from lanes.json"**: Re-run task finalization so the WP is assigned to a lane.
- **No prompt shown**: Run `/spec-kitty.implement` or `spec-kitty agent action implement` again.
