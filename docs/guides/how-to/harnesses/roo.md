# Roo Cline (deprecated)

> **Roo Code shut down on 2026-05-15 and is no longer supported.**

`spec-kitty init --ai roo` is rejected — Roo Cline can no longer be targeted as a
new harness. This page is retained only so existing links keep resolving.

## Existing projects with a `.roo/` directory

Projects that already contain a `.roo/` directory will receive a deprecation
notice during `spec-kitty upgrade`. The `.roo/` directory is **preserved** and is
not deleted automatically. To remove Roo from your project configuration, run:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config remove roo
```
