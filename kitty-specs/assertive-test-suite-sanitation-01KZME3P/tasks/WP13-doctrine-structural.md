During /spec-kitty.implement this WP may branch from a dependency-specific base, but completed changes must merge back into pr/assertive-test-suite-sanitation unless the human explicitly redirects the landing branch.

# WP13 — Doctrine and Resolver Structural Sanitation

## Do First

Load `architect-alphonso`; read FR-006/FR-007, current charter/doctrine/glossary/resolution authorities, and WP01's manifest. Verify tracker assignment/comment, claim WP13 canonically, and use only its worktree.

## Objective

Adjudicate the coherent doctrine/charter/glossary/resolver structural family. Delete retired names, exact layout/prose, and positive-shape comparisons; preserve only current authority boundaries with executable two-sided bite.

## T061 — Family Census

- Reconcile every owned path to WP01. Record authority, corpus, scanner kind, oracle, positive/negative shape, consumers, and route.
- Give every assigned file a terminal verdict. Group proof only for identical authority, production path, corpus, oracle, platform, and fault.

## T062 — Assertive Reduction

- Delete historical shape/name/prose/layout checks and advisory-only output without current authority.
- Reduce mixed files to the smallest live negative boundary; remove local dead helpers/imports only.

## T063 — Survivor Proof

- Every survivor or valid family must scan nonzero live corpus and fail its intended assertion under a realistic prohibited doctrine/resolver change.
- Require compliant control green; import/collection/parser failure and literal pasting do not count.

## T064 — Validation/Evidence

- Focused collection/pytest for every survivor; `ruff` changed files and focused mypy where needed.
- Record terminal rows, commands/env/hashes, corpus, fault, costs, and node deltas in WP13 artifacts.

## T065 — Integration Handoff

- Emit deterministic deleted/renamed architectural paths for WP07; do not edit the central shard map.
- Commit exact ownership only; complete architecture gate follows WP07 integration.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All assigned files terminally adjudicated.
- [ ] Every survivor has node/family two-sided causal proof.
- [ ] Deleted paths are in the WP07 handoff; focused validation passes.

## Reviewer Guidance

Reject historical doctrine prestige, exact resolver layout, empty corpora, literal-paste probes, and cross-family proof inheritance. Sample each family independently.
